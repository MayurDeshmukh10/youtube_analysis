LMDA-zEEQUM,Honest Trailers Commentary - The Oscars (2019),"I love Joe’s point about Spike’s idea behind the ending, ambiguity can be dangerous. Yes, I am watching this super late!"
LMDA-zEEQUM,Honest Trailers Commentary - The Oscars (2019),"Bo Rap is a masterpiece, maybe you have to be British to get it."
LMDA-zEEQUM,Honest Trailers Commentary - The Oscars (2019),It just stroke me that both WW and Logan had kinda crappy third acts too
LMDA-zEEQUM,Honest Trailers Commentary - The Oscars (2019),11:30 You guys nailed the argument against the nonsensical backlash that comic book nerds and rabid infinity war fans have come up with- Black Panther is far far more deserving of the nomination
LMDA-zEEQUM,Honest Trailers Commentary - The Oscars (2019),What kind of bear is best? Wrong. Black Bears.
LMDA-zEEQUM,Honest Trailers Commentary - The Oscars (2019),"""8 movies at the same time man.."" *is he referencing Office Space joke?*"

LMDA-zEEQUM,Honest Trailers Commentary - The Oscars (2019),"DAN IS THE BEST,  the other two just make jokes."
LMDA-zEEQUM,Honest Trailers Commentary - The Oscars (2019),Joe is so funny
LMDA-zEEQUM,Honest Trailers Commentary - The Oscars (2019),Christian Bale AS Richard Dreyfuss playing Dick Cheny...
LMDA-zEEQUM,Honest Trailers Commentary - The Oscars (2019),I might not have loved black panther but if it does win I won’t be mad because that might give other great comic book movies chances to even be nominated for best picture.
LMDA-zEEQUM,Honest Trailers Commentary - The Oscars (2019),"Hey, if that R. Kelly song is good, I'm gonna listen to it. I'll be damned if I let the fact that someone is a terrible person prevent me from enjoying their art."
LMDA-zEEQUM,Honest Trailers Commentary - The Oscars (2019),Paddington 2 was the biggest snub don't @ me
LMDA-zEEQUM,Honest Trailers Commentary - The Oscars (2019),"Honestly, the issue of Black Panther's nomination is that BP did absolutely nothing new. There was no clever, innovative structure or unique villain or any difficult goal the movie succeeded in accomplishing. It was simply a fun, flawed comic book movie; just like 80% of the MCU. BP's nomination is so controversial to me because it was a middle-of-the-road, entertaining movie that somehow is nominated for Best Picture over Infinity War, which whether you enjoyed IW or not was much more ambitious, much more clever, and handled a much more difficult concept, all the while juggling a gargantuan cast and 20 different character arcs and still managed to deliver a cohesive final product. BP is on the ticket for the exact same reason BlacKKKlansman and Vice are on, and that is so a bunch of rich white Hollywood elites feel good about their social impact by elevating decent films solely based on the topic being discussed instead of the execution of the topic. That is the issue with BP's nomination; the nomination isn't for the quality of the movie but rather for self-serving social commentary."
LMDA-zEEQUM,Honest Trailers Commentary - The Oscars (2019),But the make up guys should do the costume guy's music
LMDA-zEEQUM,Honest Trailers Commentary - The Oscars (2019),One of your best trailers in awhile! You guys killed it. Keep em coming!
LMDA-zEEQUM,Honest Trailers Commentary - The Oscars (2019),The Favourite and Blackkklansman are the only films i feel strongly about.
LMDA-zEEQUM,Honest Trailers Commentary - The Oscars (2019),"See the funny thing here is Blackkklansman is the movie I would be almost the most annoyed if won. Vice and Rhapsody are such nothing movies, but Blackkklansman is just a movie that the world DOES NOT NEED right now. If there is any organization that didn't need to add fictional events to make them seem more evil it is the KKK and the left exaggarating about how the right is is kind of how we ended in this fucking mess we are in. There are few things I hate more than movies having their primary theme centered around ''THIS MOVIE WAS IMPORTANT!''. Vice did that too, and did it worse so that is the one I would be most pissed about but Blackkklansman is a close second. We know the KKK is evil, you don't have to add in fictional bombs to make them seem that way."
LMDA-zEEQUM,Honest Trailers Commentary - The Oscars (2019),SPY-MAN
LMDA-zEEQUM,Honest Trailers Commentary - The Oscars (2019),"I agree with Dan's point on comic book movies under one condition, if all next comic book movies are set in a non white community"
LMDA-zEEQUM,Honest Trailers Commentary - The Oscars (2019),"Speaking about ""Green book"", I'm surprised you didn't bring up the press-tour where he makes an @$$ out of himself and the black cast just looks at him being like ""Just staaahp!"" 22:30"
LMDA-zEEQUM,Honest Trailers Commentary - The Oscars (2019),"Joe Starr has literally stolen my thoughts out my brain and replicated them perfectly here. How did you do this, Joe?"
LMDA-zEEQUM,Honest Trailers Commentary - The Oscars (2019),Bohemian Rhapsody is the worst movie to get a nomination I think I know of. It has good songs!! Thats it.
LMDA-zEEQUM,Honest Trailers Commentary - The Oscars (2019),"Once I heard Bohemian Rhapsody was going to sideline his sexuality I decided I wasn't going to see it unless it was really standout, and it wasn't. A Queen biopic would've been a great chance to do actually address AIDS from a different perspective and not just make a cool music video movie skirting around a serious issue that reverberates to this day."
LMDA-zEEQUM,Honest Trailers Commentary - The Oscars (2019),"Last year, the first sci do movie won best picture (the shape of water), if black panther wins this year, the academy might finally be acknowledging more types of movies (black panther is not only a comic book movie, but Blockbusters barely ever win, too)"
LMDA-zEEQUM,Honest Trailers Commentary - The Oscars (2019),I'm gonna say it: Infinity War was better. Black Panther was better than the rest of the best picture nominees though. Don't @ me.
LMDA-zEEQUM,Honest Trailers Commentary - The Oscars (2019),can we get a sorry to bother you trailer
LMDA-zEEQUM,Honest Trailers Commentary - The Oscars (2019),"Eh let’s be honest, the fact the BP is a comic book movie has nothing to do with the nomination. It was a movie with an almost entirely black cast that made a lot of money. That’s the only reason it got Oscar approval."
LMDA-zEEQUM,Honest Trailers Commentary - The Oscars (2019),"The only thing that bothers me about how inaccurate Bohemian Rhapsody is is that they say he’s just gay, but he was clearly bisexual and even dated another woman after Mary for a long time. So now, a lot of people will likely think Freddie was gay and not bi and we’ll lose a bit of his history"
LMDA-zEEQUM,Honest Trailers Commentary - The Oscars (2019),"Please film a wandering earth review, more people need to know about this crazy movie"
LMDA-zEEQUM,Honest Trailers Commentary - The Oscars (2019),"I don't really agree with Dan's point - The inaccuracies in Man on the Moon is part of the joke of that film: Jim Carrey in character as Andy Kaufman even states at the beginning of the film that events in his life get mixed around in the movie and that he hates it and then he tells everyone to leave the theatre, which works for the film knowing what we know about Kaufman. The inaccuracies in Bohemian Rhapsody are just sad and emotionally manipulative in order for a ""big pay off"" to the Live Aid performance. It's not in anyway the same because tonally both films are so different but I do agree with Dan that there were at least fifty films released last year that should have been nominated for Best Picture in its place - in fact most films released last year were probably more worthy of this nomination."
LMDA-zEEQUM,Honest Trailers Commentary - The Oscars (2019),"My black panther and bohemian rant, is if either of them win, then that instance should have gone to Mad Max over Spotlight. That was such a no brainer it hurts."
LMDA-zEEQUM,Honest Trailers Commentary - The Oscars (2019),Why didn't the Winter Soldier get nominated for best picture years ago?! I'm still salty about that.
LMDA-zEEQUM,Honest Trailers Commentary - The Oscars (2019),"3:13 I'm pretty sure Taran from Linus Tech Tips did this at LTX last year. 


If the Oscars wanna give it a go all I'm sayin is I'd better see some LIVE HAND-DRAWN ANIMATION."
LMDA-zEEQUM,Honest Trailers Commentary - The Oscars (2019),This is a weird Oscar season. Only really hoping into the spider verse takes best animated over incredibles
LMDA-zEEQUM,Honest Trailers Commentary - The Oscars (2019),"I think the Bohemian rhapsody was a great musical. I watched it without any cinematographic expectations, but the great music just balanced out everything else. Does it deserve an Oscar? Well, compared to say Moonlight - sure it does. You have to understand Oscars are political, the last 5 years the awards (and some of the nominations) has simply baffled me, so I honestly don't expect anything good from this years's ceremony. I like the Black Panther, I think it's a good, stand-alone movie and sure I don't mind if it gets an Oscar. And I don't care if the movie is going to get an awards because the cast is black, or if the whole controversy actually started because the case is black. It's a good movie. Is it better than Deadpool 1? No. But it's ok. And you know, I'm glad Marvel doesn't get awards. Because it simply wouldn't be fair. If you ask me what is the best movie of 2018, I'd say from what I watched ""A star is born"" is the best."
LMDA-zEEQUM,Honest Trailers Commentary - The Oscars (2019),"I did find Bohemian Rhapsody enjoyable, but my first reaction walking out of the theater, was that the movie was a bit depressing. Considering how wild a life he led, the movie is depressing.  and that is part of my second point, I was disappointed when I found out how inaccurate the movie was. I usually stay away from biopics for how notoriously unreliable they are, but Freddie Mercury had a crazy life, and they should have been able to make a movie about his life without lying. He took princess Diana to a gay club in ""drag"" and I was hoping to see where they got approached to do the soundtrack for Flash Gordon. I suppose you're right about the other band members not allowing it, so I suppose we'll have to wait another twenty years, then we'll get the accurate Freddie Mercury Movie. And hey, Rami can play Freddie's Father."
LMDA-zEEQUM,Honest Trailers Commentary - The Oscars (2019),I heard that echo...
LMDA-zEEQUM,Honest Trailers Commentary - The Oscars (2019),"9:40 don't think I missed that, joe"
LMDA-zEEQUM,Honest Trailers Commentary - The Oscars (2019),Is this a new set?
LMDA-zEEQUM,Honest Trailers Commentary - The Oscars (2019),"wouldn't it be weird if green book won ,spike lee was angry that driving miss daisy had black man driving a white women around then it won best picture and now he could lose to green book which has  a white man driving a black man around"
LMDA-zEEQUM,Honest Trailers Commentary - The Oscars (2019),I'd be super happy for Blackkklansman. So good and Spike Lee is a treasure
LMDA-zEEQUM,Honest Trailers Commentary - The Oscars (2019),Missed opportunity to intro with a Michael Buffer voice.
LMDA-zEEQUM,Honest Trailers Commentary - The Oscars (2019),5:05 I don't just feel something about Vice I think it's one of the best films ever made. But I'm not an Academy voter
LMDA-zEEQUM,Honest Trailers Commentary - The Oscars (2019),I think the biggest Oscar snubs this year were 8th Grade and Sorry To Bother You.
LMDA-zEEQUM,Honest Trailers Commentary - The Oscars (2019),"Even though it doesn't exist, I already like your version of the Oscars with the live editing competition, being live hairstyled... Yeah, that would make the show so much better. I propose all Best Actress/Actor and Supporting nominees should have to accept the award in character, in accordance with this plan."
LMDA-zEEQUM,Honest Trailers Commentary - The Oscars (2019),It really figures that the day that I couldn’t use my phone that you streamed this live. So sad now .....
LMDA-zEEQUM,Honest Trailers Commentary - The Oscars (2019),Rami Malek should win the Oscar
LMDA-zEEQUM,Honest Trailers Commentary - The Oscars (2019),"But seriously, Black Couguar is not a good movie."
LMDA-zEEQUM,Honest Trailers Commentary - The Oscars (2019),"it's not like I don't like most nominees, but I don't really care about them. Hereditary, Blindspotting and Eight Grade are way better."
LMDA-zEEQUM,Honest Trailers Commentary - The Oscars (2019),During the Cesars in France (the French Oscars) they actually filmed and edited together a short film during the ceremony itself using quick shots of the famous French actors in the audience. It was quite funny.

LMDA-zEEQUM,Honest Trailers Commentary - The Oscars (2019),"I think Blackkklansman was the best movie last year for me. At least one of the top 2 or 3 for sure. And I haven't seen, most of the best picture nominees or a ton of others so take that for what it is. But as far as the ending of the movie, for me the movie ended and then we got a message from the director. Like a hey dipshit, this isn't a thing of the past. It's still a problem now. And so I almost don't count that as part of the movie but that's just how I took it and when it's something as important as this subject matter I'm okay with a 5 minute editorial/message at the end. Now if a movie ends and then we get a ""Now here's why the earth is flat and everyone is lying to you"" I'd have an issue with it."
LMDA-zEEQUM,Honest Trailers Commentary - The Oscars (2019),What's the deal with the weird aspect ratio on the Shallow Hal clip?

LMDA-zEEQUM,Honest Trailers Commentary - The Oscars (2019),Why Black Panther was nominated over Infinity War is beyond my grasp

LMDA-zEEQUM,Honest Trailers Commentary - The Oscars (2019),"While I also wouldn't nominate Black Panther, I'd take out like half the movies on this list before I take out that one. The list is just _really_ bad imo."
LMDA-zEEQUM,Honest Trailers Commentary - The Oscars (2019),Omg the Black Panther trailer was perfection. Especially the “I personally liked Infinity War better” line. Just 💯/💯.
LMDA-zEEQUM,Honest Trailers Commentary - The Oscars (2019),i guess it's because i'm short on time but i find myself just watching this and not the actual honest trailer it's lovely because I get both
LMDA-zEEQUM,Honest Trailers Commentary - The Oscars (2019),Black Panther is overrated. If it wins it’s pandering to the utmost degree. Just cause we are want a good comic book movie to get nominated doesn’t mean we want to be pandered to. Y’all looking at this so black and white. Oddly enough the world doesn’t work like that.
LMDA-zEEQUM,Honest Trailers Commentary - The Oscars (2019),"Black Panther is a good movie, but a lot of people feel that there's been better comic book movies that weren't nominated, so it's a legitimate question for them to ask, ""Why is THIS one the first?"" Whatever you think the answer to that question is, fine. But if someone postulates that PERHAPS the fact that there was so much attention paid by pop culture to the fact that it's the ""first black superhero movie"" (even though it isn't...), and that therefore the Academy (well known for having liberal leanings and often giving particular attention to movies that lean that way, sometimes even if they're not particularly good, like Crash) singling it out to nominate might have something to do with race relations more than it does with filmmaking... it doesn't mean they're racist and just hate Black Panther because they hate black people. It means that they're recognizing a pretty likely reality. 


But this is a way that people try to shut down the criticism without actually addressing any of the real arguments against the movie. They just ASSUME why you don't like the movie because they've convinced themselves there's only one reason that anybody could ever have for not liking the movie. 



I mostly do like the movie. It's well-made, the acting is good, there's some good action in it, the story is decent, and SOME interesting ideas are brought up. Kilmonger is an interesting villain, and his death scene is beautiful. Wakanda is a cool place that's well realized. Shuri is a really likeable character.
But I recognize there are plenty of problems with the movie too. T'Challa is a rather bland protagonist. I don't know quite what it is, but the spark that he had in Civil War just isn't there here. It may be Boseman's performance, which seems strangely reserved, even at times when perhaps he ought to be a bit more passionate to actually be a compelling lead. He had more passion and emotion in Civil War.


I don't like that Martin Freeman's character is such a rosey, friendly, heroic image of the CIA in Africa, when the real history of the CIA in Africa (as well as the rest of the world) would have them be the villains of this movie. It's clear that he's meant to be the ""token white guy"" (or ""Tolkien white guy"" along with Andy Serkis) who serves as the sounding board for flippant colonization references, yet is still this wholesome helpful guy who's instrumental in saving the day! This is an example of something that could have been interesting and really had a message to it, but it feels so shallow and manipulative. If they had actually allowed for some bold storytelling, they would have given Freeman some more nuance, and had his character end up being a third-party conflict. Maybe he's actually on a secret CIA mission to gather intel about vibranium because the US government is seeking to pillage it. That would be a more interesting and realistic use of a CIA agent in the story. It would also add another dimension to the decision to give vibranium to the world at the end. That's the kind of storytelling decision I'd say would make it more Oscar-worthy, if they pulled it off well.


And uh... get rid of the f**king CGI rhinos.
The climax of the movie feels too conventional for a story that had felt more unique and interesting when it hinged on ideological differences. But there's no resolution on that front, other than to kill the guys we disagree with who want to do ""bad things"". Part of what made Kilmonger interesting is that he has SOME credibility when it comes to his concerns about oppressed black people worldwide. The ending of the movie with T'Challa opening Wakanda to the world, starting the schools/charity, etc... is cool and all, but it's an afterthought instead of being the resolution. Kilmonger dying is the way things are really resolved. Wouldn't it have been great if T'Challa had actually just told Kilmonger, ""Hey, how about we do this to help our oppressed brothers and sisters instead of blowing shit up?"". Kilmonger then has to justify why he wants to take the violent route, and then if they come to blows over it, it becomes an exploration of the nature of violence and whether it's the right answer. This is somewhat brought up, but not really explored. Exploring that in the scene, between the characters, is when it really matters. But instead they fight, Kilmonger dies, they blow up the ships, bad guys die and it's the easy way out. The theme is somewhat abandoned during the climax, and then only comes back into play for the denouement as a sort of ""button"" to the story instead of the climax. The pros and cons of violent means to supposedly righteous ends are never really weighed in any real way. Violence ends up being used to solve the problem of the threat of violence... what's the message there in the end, if there even is one? That's not great screenwriting... it's better than average, because at least it brought up these themes at all, but to be a great screenplay, you have to really delve into it and explore it more powerfully and integrally. The mark of a great comic book movie, IMO, is that it transcends being a comic book movie. The climax of this movie feels right dang smack in the middle of being a typical Hollywood comic book movie. Compare it to The Dark Knight, where our hero ends up in a stalemate with the villain and the climactic scene is literally them just talking about the nature of Gotham's society and pontificating about how their ideological differences have destined them to do this forever (shot in a really unique way, clearly visualizing the opposite ""ying and yang"" dynamic between them as the Joker is literally upside down and we twist to match his perspective opposite Batman's upright, ""normal"" perspective), before we get to the unconventional fourth act ending between our heroes and a fallen hero that involves a tough dilemma of covering up the fallen hero's crimes for the sake of the greater good, cutting to black with our hero on the run from the law, yet being glorified for doing so. That's an interesting climax and resolution. That's the type of movie I'd say is worthy of a Best Picture nomination, if not at least a Best Screenplay nom. It's actually challenging in terms of whether it's the right thing for the hero to do, and it really leans into that gray area. It forces the audience to ask themselves value questions that the film doesn't necessarily give an easy answer to. Black Panther tries to give easy answers and make the ending feel unquestionably positive.  Kilmonger dying is a sad scene, but once he's gone, things are all peachy, and T'Challa just up and decides to change Wakanda's ways because... it's time, i guess There's no weight given to the complicated concerns of what ""opening Wakanda to the world"" will actually entail and what the effects might be, for both Wakanda and the world. That's not really an exploration. It just kinda happens, and the real reason we're meant to like it is because ""Ooh, that means Wakanda tech will be in other movies now! Coolzies!"" Meanwhile, we get a nice little subtle message of ""Globalization = Good!"" and/or ""Using small sovereign nations for their resources = Good!"" 
Sounds like an American classic, I guess.


None of these are fatal flaws necessarily, and like I said, I do still think it's an overall good movie. But I don't think it's a great movie on the level of The Dark Knight, and there are better contenders just this year when it comes to comic book movies that deserve recognition. Infinity War had a way tougher job to do than Black Panther did, and it succeeded more flawlessly, IMO. It actually did do something unconventional with its story, and took more bold risks in how it dealt with its themes. The events that actually happened in it are what have made a cultural impact (not to mention an impact on the series' story), instead of its impact being mostly based on (you have to admit it)... the cast's race. The ""Snappening"" has had way more impact than anything from Black Panther, including ""Wakana Forever!"", which even Chadwick Boseman got sick of... and Michael B Jordon wanted nothing to do with.


So at the end of the day, it really does feel like the logical answer to ""Why is THIS one the first?"" is that it happened to be a successful film starring a black cast, that at least brings up some black issues, and the Academy felt that deserved to be recognized above films that actually had more bold, unique and resonating storytelling. And that would be fine, if it wasn't treated like this wasn't the case, and if the defenders of the movie didn't feel the need to make it seem like even suggesting that it might be the case makes you racist. It's not racist to recognize what the major element of the movie is that people seem to like or be paying attention to. If people JUST liked it because it's a good comic book movie, or because they think the story was well told, then the defense of the movie would be focused on that. But that's never the defense that's used. I only ever see it defended on the basis of it being ""groundbreaking"" for black representation, and that's why it's significant. That's true, and that's great in and of itself... but that doesn't necessarily make it a good movie. If you want to argue that ""Best Picture"" also entails the movie's place in history and how significant is in terms of things like minority representation... then fine, make that argument. But don't dismiss the people who care more about the quality of the movie itself as a movie and had legitimate problems on that front... either as racists or ""whiners"" just to make yourself feel righteous and mature. That's really not fair."

LMDA-zEEQUM,Honest Trailers Commentary - The Oscars (2019),"Did anyone else think that ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" felt like it got started only to stall out like ten minutes later? Sure, LiveAid was a good sequence, but such a brilliant band deserves a brilliant movie. Maybe the entire film should have unfolded at LiveAid. I dunno, but it got pretty boring fast."
LMDA-zEEQUM,Honest Trailers Commentary - The Oscars (2019),"I dunno if I'll actually watch the awards. The thing is that every category should have twice the number of nominees just to keep with the times of increasing numbers of films. I'm upset ""Widows,"" ""Hereditary,"" ""Ant-Man and the Wasp,"" ""Eighth Grade"" and even ""Suspiria"" get snubbed. ""Widows"" had several breakout performances and brilliant editing, ""Hereditary"" had a great actress and director, ""Ant-Man"" was fun and visually fantastic (note: do we REALLY have to nominate the new ""Avengers: Infinity War""? How about ""Solo""?), ""Eighth Grade"" I expected several things from, and ""Suspiria"" had great Make-Up and tech."

LMDA-zEEQUM,Honest Trailers Commentary - The Oscars (2019),"When it comes to bohemian rhapsody, I can’t tell if the people who think it’s the worst movie ever made are a very vocal minority or if they actually represent a significant portion of the populace. What’s the deal?"
LMDA-zEEQUM,Honest Trailers Commentary - The Oscars (2019),"I’m all about a comic book movie getting best picture, but I just watched Black Panther, and the best part is Michael B. Jordan. The rest is a mediocre story that’s designed beautifully. Except for the rhinos. I honestly don’t get the hype. Please feel free to educate me! I’m very willing to admit it’s my ignorance."
LMDA-zEEQUM,Honest Trailers Commentary - The Oscars (2019),"John C. Reilly is also, as far as I’m aware, the only actor who had 3 films in theaters concurrently this year."
LMDA-zEEQUM,Honest Trailers Commentary - The Oscars (2019),the oscars suck.
LMDA-zEEQUM,Honest Trailers Commentary - The Oscars (2019),i'm wondering when SJN will upgrade the camera to have at least 1080p60.

LMDA-zEEQUM,Honest Trailers Commentary - The Oscars (2019),"The end of blackklansman was good because beeing french I did not know this happens in America, today."
LMDA-zEEQUM,Honest Trailers Commentary - The Oscars (2019),"Who was Mr.Rogers?
Cuz he did a good Mr. Rogers"
LMDA-zEEQUM,Honest Trailers Commentary - The Oscars (2019),"Spider-verse not having a Best Picture nomination is the big snub for me, especially since they didn't even fill out the last two slots. It's far and away the best animated film and deserves to be in more than just the Animation category. It's easily up there with any other movie out this year."
LMDA-zEEQUM,Honest Trailers Commentary - The Oscars (2019),I would be good with blackkklansman
LMDA-zEEQUM,Honest Trailers Commentary - The Oscars (2019),"I want Bohemian Rhapsody to win. Mainly because I loved it. Also, because the shit storm would be amazing. Weird that it had no director."
LMDA-zEEQUM,Honest Trailers Commentary - The Oscars (2019),"On the topic of pivotal alternate universe flashpoints, I'd point to the early 00's Writer's Strike. That season led to a lot of reality TV shows getting greenlit, including the Apprentice. One thing leads to another, and boom we're in the darkest timeline."
LMDA-zEEQUM,Honest Trailers Commentary - The Oscars (2019),I wouldn't recommend mocking a majority of your audience's opinion about black panther. Doesn't seem smart.
LMDA-zEEQUM,Honest Trailers Commentary - The Oscars (2019),Does Dan have a scar down the left hand side of his face?
LMDA-zEEQUM,Honest Trailers Commentary - The Oscars (2019),"I'm with Dan.  Spiderverse was the best superhero last year.  It checked the same social boxes as Black Panther, but was just way better.  But I dont begrudge it its nomination, I just would have picked a different horse."
LMDA-zEEQUM,Honest Trailers Commentary - The Oscars (2019),I will actually watch this clusterfuck this year just because it's been such a giant clusterfuck.
LMDA-zEEQUM,Honest Trailers Commentary - The Oscars (2019),11:45 now I want to hear Dan’s list of 50 movies he put in before Bohemian Rhapsody
LMDA-zEEQUM,Honest Trailers Commentary - The Oscars (2019),Dont tell me to watch the Honest Trailer Spencer
LMDA-zEEQUM,Honest Trailers Commentary - The Oscars (2019),"Black Panther was just your typical cookie cutter super hero movie with an above average antagonist. I don't really care that it is nominated for the Oscars, because I think the Oscars are pretty pointless."
LMDA-zEEQUM,Honest Trailers Commentary - The Oscars (2019),Always great to see JTE.
LMDA-zEEQUM,Honest Trailers Commentary - The Oscars (2019),how could they not nominate Ashes by celine dion (deadpool 2)???? That makes no sense
LMDA-zEEQUM,Honest Trailers Commentary - The Oscars (2019),"You know, if Dan hosted the Oscars, I might actually be interested in watching it...

LMDA-zEEQUM,Honest Trailers Commentary - The Oscars (2019),We live in a world where Suicide Squad has an Oscar and Logan doesn't
LMDA-zEEQUM,Honest Trailers Commentary - The Oscars (2019),"I'm not sure if Black Panther will help other comic book movies in the future because I don't think it was nominated for how good of a movie it was. I think it will help other comic book movies that have political messages but that's it. For the record I don't hate Black Panther, I think it's fine, but I think it was nominated solely for it's cultural relevance and that's not what Best Picture should be based on imo."
LMDA-zEEQUM,Honest Trailers Commentary - The Oscars (2019),It’s already disappointing because Eighth Grade was completely snubbed. And honestly would have loved to see Spider-Verse in the Best Picture category.... I can think of at least 2 that are in now that don’t need to be lol
LMDA-zEEQUM,Honest Trailers Commentary - The Oscars (2019),"People do overrate Black Panther hard. It is another paint by numbers Marvel movie. No better or worse than Winter Soldier, Doctor Strange, Avengers, etc"
LMDA-zEEQUM,Honest Trailers Commentary - The Oscars (2019),That echo is crazy!

LMDA-zEEQUM,Honest Trailers Commentary - The Oscars (2019),"I think what bugs me the most about some of the Black Panther backlash is when people say it was only nominated because it had an all Black cast. It really devalues the movie and the legit hard work and effort present from Ryan Coogler and company along with the acting from said black cast.

The poor CGI from the climax doesn’t reflect the whole movie before anyone says that. Even then, we still got a beautiful moment after said climax is over."
LMDA-zEEQUM,Honest Trailers Commentary - The Oscars (2019),"Is the sound like a plane taking off at 19:50 the sound of the removal men clearing out the office? Why does Dan keep checking his watch? Wow, who'd have thought the film about the KKK would potentially be the least controversial Best Picture winner. I got very emotional at the end of Blackkklansman so I was glad they included those clips, even though it was a big tonal shift & kind of a downer way to end a film with a lot of comedy."
LMDA-zEEQUM,Honest Trailers Commentary - The Oscars (2019),"I'm happy to see precedent set for recognizing comic book movies, but Logan really should've been the one to set it. Patrick Stewart should've at least gotten a nod for supporting actor."

LMDA-zEEQUM,Honest Trailers Commentary - The Oscars (2019),"I'd be pretty happy if Black Panther won best picture as it'd be a big win for the genre. Is it the best picture of the year? It's hard to say. Out of the list of nominees, it's definitely one of the best. Perhaps the only other movies deserving would be The Favorite and Roma, but we'll have to see how it all goes down..."

LMDA-zEEQUM,Honest Trailers Commentary - The Oscars (2019),2:45 That's not funny. That's a really good idea! A reenactment of one scene from each best picture!live on stage. Genius
LMDA-zEEQUM,Honest Trailers Commentary - The Oscars (2019),"There's a reason  Bohemian Rhapsody got an A cinemascore, made over $800M and it got the votes to get a best picture nomination. For me, and for a lot of other people, it was genuinely one of the best films of the year. The overwhelming majority of people who hate it are the critics, which is hardly a surprise as they hate on almost everything Queen does, and the majority of the minority left over are people who either wanted a documentary or think they know Freddie and what he would've wanted better than the people who, yknow, actually knew him best. It's okay to have your opinion, but stop pretending your opinion is universal fact. It's not."
LMDA-zEEQUM,Honest Trailers Commentary - The Oscars (2019),There has never been a comic book movie that was the best film of its year the Oscars are just desperate

LMDA-zEEQUM,Honest Trailers Commentary - The Oscars (2019),"While I do love me some Dan rants, you guys gotta realize that the whole black panther thing isn't fans changing their minds. The thing is fandoms are fill with literally millions of people with different opinions and people that are angry about something yell a lot louder than people that are happy or content about something. The comic book fans that wanted an oscar nomination and the comic book fans that are angry that black panther got a nomination by and large aren't the same people. You're acting as if all comic book fans are 1 single entity that is randomly changing its mind. When in fact the people that wanted an oscar nomination stopped yelling cause they got what they wanted but then people that don't like black panther started yelling. So the volume of yelling didn't change much, but it wasn't hypocrisy."

LMDA-zEEQUM,Honest Trailers Commentary - The Oscars (2019),I'm not that much of a fan of Black Panther. My thoughts. I think it deserved Best Director more so than Best Picture. That's how I felt with Wonder Woman. Doesn't deserves a Best Pic win but I can see it deserving Best Director and neither happened.

LMDA-zEEQUM,Honest Trailers Commentary - The Oscars (2019),Logan should have been nominated last year. Also impersonating my neighbor just feels very wrong. Wish you guys hadn't done that.
LMDA-zEEQUM,Honest Trailers Commentary - The Oscars (2019),Well it’s because the comic book movies people wanted nominated for an Oscar were amazing movies in all facets.
LMDA-zEEQUM,Honest Trailers Commentary - The Oscars (2019),I love this hahah.
LMDA-zEEQUM,Honest Trailers Commentary - The Oscars (2019),This Oscar's feels like one huge circus
LMDA-zEEQUM,Honest Trailers Commentary - The Oscars (2019),"I didn't mind the historical inaccuracies in Green Book that much. The family seemed mostly concerned about whether the relationship between them was an employment or a friendship, which is not as major as changing someone's personality traits or the events that actually happened for example. 
It has been established that it was a fact that he had definitely fallen out with his family and didn't interact with them much, so IDK if I trust his brother's account of his relationship with his employees because I don't think he witnessed it first-hand. Also, his main argument was a snooty ""oh my brother would never fraternize with the hired help"""
LMDA-zEEQUM,Honest Trailers Commentary - The Oscars (2019),Is it weird that I prefer watching the commentaries instead of the trailer? The Trailer interspersed with the guys more in depth/jokey comments is more enjoyable for me.

LMDA-zEEQUM,Honest Trailers Commentary - The Oscars (2019),"Based off of what Rami Malek has said in interviews, the Live AID performance was the very first thing they shot, so it's probably safe to say that Bryan Singer actually did that part, and not Dexter Fletcher."
LMDA-zEEQUM,Honest Trailers Commentary - The Oscars (2019),"The best picture thing is so weird, I have zero clue what's going to happen. I will really not be surprised about any of them winning tbh"
LMDA-zEEQUM,Honest Trailers Commentary - The Oscars (2019),"dear dan people are dumb, if they're going to watch a ""biopic"" they will asume every thing in there is true. And joe is right about the ending of black klansman, i live in brazil and there people in the right that say that the nazis were comunist, the german government made a video explaning what the nazis were, and they said that germans don't understand nazism"
LMDA-zEEQUM,Honest Trailers Commentary - The Oscars (2019),Black Panther isn't even the best 2018 Marvel movie it should not be nominated for best picture

LMDA-zEEQUM,Honest Trailers Commentary - The Oscars (2019),"You guys are so right about Roma. It’s such a masterful film but no one wants to watch because they have to laugh or see an action scene every two seconds instead of recognizing true art, plus normies are too pathetic and lazy to read subtitles. It’s like if a movie has no flashy spectacle then people will say it’s boring and bad. Pathetic. Roma is the best film of the year and I hope it wins Best Picture."
LMDA-zEEQUM,Honest Trailers Commentary - The Oscars (2019),Can anyone share the link to the sketch that Dan was talking about? I have faith in Internet.
LMDA-zEEQUM,Honest Trailers Commentary - The Oscars (2019),The only controversy about Black KKKlansmen seems to be from the director of Sorry to Bother you hating on Spike and the cop the movie is about.   Could be interesting tweets if it wins.
LMDA-zEEQUM,Honest Trailers Commentary - The Oscars (2019),One of the few times I only need to  watch the commentary
LMDA-zEEQUM,Honest Trailers Commentary - The Oscars (2019),"Thank you Dan for admitting that you wouldn't have nominated Black Panther for Best Picture. To be honest, it's a pretty weak slate of nominations this year. I'd cut Bohemian Rhapsody and Vice off that list before cutting Black Panther. If anything other than Roma or The Favourite win I'll be very disappointed."
LMDA-zEEQUM,Honest Trailers Commentary - The Oscars (2019),Please tell me SJU will be doing a live stream of the oscars. I want to watch it so damn bad.
LMDA-zEEQUM,Honest Trailers Commentary - The Oscars (2019),How is Roma divisive??
LMDA-zEEQUM,Honest Trailers Commentary - The Oscars (2019),"Fun fact: Every time these guys make an Honest Trailer for a Best Picture-nominated movie before the Oscars–or they hint that they will make one–that movie did not win Best Picture. So that means Black Panther and next week’s target will not win.

(Also, that means one of these movies will be pushed off the schedule indefinitely:

Ralph Breaks the Internet
Elektra (2005)
Fantastic Beasts 2)"
UcbFg__aMvA,Honest Trailer Commentaries - The Mummy (2017),"Maybe it’s just me watching backlogs of “Honest Commentaries” long after Signore was removed from the show for alleged #MeToo reasons, but these old episodes with Signore are nearly unwatchable. He’s not a good moderator,  and everyone else in these episodes appears stiffer, less funny, and more joyless during the whole process with the Signore blackhole at the helm. Yeeesh."
UcbFg__aMvA,Honest Trailer Commentaries - The Mummy (2017),"Whatever happened to Brandon Fraser, its good that he is not a part of this movie. It was very distressing to hear Fraser's ordeal. To see even a grown man is not safe in this world from sexual harrassment, is seriously disheartening."
UcbFg__aMvA,Honest Trailer Commentaries - The Mummy (2017),"I actually can see a route how this could have worked. If you made Cruise the bad guy by the end (like they teased but didn't commit to) and were less hammy with pointing to what's coming, then the goal of it becomes gathering monsters (Avengers) to stop death-powered Tom Cruise (Loki)"

UcbFg__aMvA,Honest Trailer Commentaries - The Mummy (2017),In my screening of remember a paying audience when that Dark Universe Logo popped up my audience laughed hard. I've never seen that before even in the best comedies I've seen I've never been in a audience that laughed that hard.

UcbFg__aMvA,Honest Trailer Commentaries - The Mummy (2017),It wasn't until I saw Dan go crazy that I realized Cruise mixed the gold scheme from Battlefield Earth into this.
UcbFg__aMvA,Honest Trailer Commentaries - The Mummy (2017),"I dunno, I could see a Frankenstein vs. Dracula level of universe working... but only if they played silly buggers with it.

UcbFg__aMvA,Honest Trailer Commentaries - The Mummy (2017),The Mummy 2017 movie is not about mummy not really . Is about Tome Cruse and only about him .
UcbFg__aMvA,Honest Trailer Commentaries - The Mummy (2017),"This could have been a great movie if they made it a real Horror movie, and not a marvel superhero movie in disguise. 
 
Cruise as a 20-30s Special Ops soldier, that  robs graves, goes anywhere he wants like he  isn't in the military, and has 2 love interests in their 30s was so unbelievable.    The Spec-Ops scout part was the worst."
UcbFg__aMvA,Honest Trailer Commentaries - The Mummy (2017),"""His name keeps appearing like a serial killer's calling card""
Couldn't stop laughing."
UcbFg__aMvA,Honest Trailer Commentaries - The Mummy (2017),"You CAN NOT mummify someone alive. Yes, there are instances of it happening naturally under special environmental circumstances, but that clearly wasn't the case here. The idea is quite silly - in order to stop the natural decomposition of the body, all the organs were removed and the body soaked in natron for a long ass time before ever being wrapped up. I will however applaud the movie for better showing the wrapping pattern of the linnen overlays, than the previous ones.. 

The chance of Tom Cruise's character ever running into anything of value (to a robber) in the Middle East is also extremely slim. I am unsure why that ever was considered a lucrative business to anyone. The amount of royal tombs found in the region are scarce, usually older and much more minimalistic than wealthy Egyptian royal tombs from the New Kingdom, which is what most people by now associate this line of movies with. Archaeology these days have very little to do with finding riches, movie makers. Not to mention the whole misconception regarding Set, but I see other people have gotten into explaining that, good on you btw.

UcbFg__aMvA,Honest Trailer Commentaries - The Mummy (2017),"I really was trying to enjoy the movie, until the moment where I realised it wasn't supposed to be scary, but comedic, and it wasn't about the mummy, but about Tom'C (and don't get me started on Mr Hide..)"

UcbFg__aMvA,Honest Trailer Commentaries - The Mummy (2017),"I ""enjoyed"" the movie for the most part, even though it has big problems"
UcbFg__aMvA,Honest Trailer Commentaries - The Mummy (2017),"When I first heard a couple of years ago that The Mummy was getting a reboot with Tom Cruise, I knew not only was I NOT going to watch it, but, that it was going to suck major ass. Then when I saw the trailer, I really knew it was going to beyond suck. The Mummy is horror, not a bunch of running, so called action, terrible acting or spin off's for other supposed horror movies that are trying to be like all of the Marvel etc., universe movies. Movies today refuse to capture the essence of or be like how movies used to be, instead it's all about spending hundreds of millions of dollars on overpaid actors that only care about making money, terrible, stupid and pointless effects, awful stories/scripts, advertising that's incomplete or better than the actual movie and refusing to take the time to actually make something entertaining. The Mummy with Brendan Fraser had its flaws, but it's still enjoyable and infinity times better than this new piece of cinematic crap. The 1932 Karloff, the 1959 Christopher Lee and the Brendan Fraser Mummy movies are the best."

UcbFg__aMvA,Honest Trailer Commentaries - The Mummy (2017),"I liked it... I did not see it in theaters because of all the terrible reviews and I found myself bored out of my mind the other day and got it on demand. Its better than transformers and it was better than the amazing Spider-Man 2. I liked seeing the jar with the creature from the black lagoons arm, vampire skulls, and even Dr. Jekyll. I wont say its great but it wasnt awful."
UcbFg__aMvA,Honest Trailer Commentaries - The Mummy (2017),yo andy i liked it because of hot mummy and yeah thats it. I mean i couldnt be the only one who wanted cruise to ditch humanity and rule the world with the mummy
UcbFg__aMvA,Honest Trailer Commentaries - The Mummy (2017),"It's weird but I did enjoy the movie (at least a little) although I agree with almost everything said in this video, plus the really bad CGI mummies, even the ones from Brendan Fraser's movie (which is awesome) looked more real.

They're literally sitting feet away from each other, can they not hear each other's voices, are they so deaf from screaming at bad movies all these years that they have to wear headphones to even partake in the simplest of conversations?!? Whhhyyyyyyyyy!!?"
UcbFg__aMvA,Honest Trailer Commentaries - The Mummy (2017),"I just watched this to see how bad it was. Not even drinks and friends could make it fun. And yes Andy the origin of the mummy was beat to death. My advice for people is to just watch the honest trailer, you'll have more fun.

- Pat"
UcbFg__aMvA,Honest Trailer Commentaries - The Mummy (2017),"You missed the Encino Man joke, or at least, the reference to un-freezing was too obscure for the joke to land. ""we're not saying thaw out the encino man,"" would have worked."
UcbFg__aMvA,Honest Trailer Commentaries - The Mummy (2017),i liked it coz of whats to come. Johnny Depp man
UcbFg__aMvA,Honest Trailer Commentaries - The Mummy (2017),Tom Cruise is a 55-year-old young man.
UcbFg__aMvA,Honest Trailer Commentaries - The Mummy (2017),"I genuinely enjoyed this movie while watching it. I was very excited by the potential of a Dark Universe because of the character dynamics that could be introduced. I think that the idea of getting a movie audience to cheer for monsters in a way that was different from what had been done before is an interesting one. That being said, I am not a Tom Cruise fan, so I was prepared to hate this movie, but I thoroughly enjoyed it, but less because of the actual story and more because of its potential. It had many fun scenes and I thought the story was intriguing. After watching it I am excited for a sequel because I want to see how Tom Cruise's character deals with being possessed by Set, mainly because of Set's role in Egyptian myth."
UcbFg__aMvA,Honest Trailer Commentaries - The Mummy (2017),"I wouldn't have clicked for anyone but Spencer on the thumbnail. Also, can you show us your upper arm tattoo?"
UcbFg__aMvA,Honest Trailer Commentaries - The Mummy (2017),"Hey guys, it will probly go like the #DCEU n make sense in reverse, several movies later."
UcbFg__aMvA,Honest Trailer Commentaries - The Mummy (2017),Something being fun is subjective Andy.
UcbFg__aMvA,Honest Trailer Commentaries - The Mummy (2017),GET OUT. I don't believe IT.  I see what you guys did there! Lol
UcbFg__aMvA,Honest Trailer Commentaries - The Mummy (2017),"I think going the abbott and costello route would be the best direction for a shared universal monster universe. Get some comedian duo who work well off each other and have them keep getting caught up in monster nonsense. I'd pay good money for 'Key and Peele meet Dracula"" or whatever"
UcbFg__aMvA,Honest Trailer Commentaries - The Mummy (2017),does anyone with a plus account feel a little cheated now that most of the content is now free on YouTube with movie fights live now streamed and commentaries released as well I do not feel like its worth paying for it anymore.
UcbFg__aMvA,Honest Trailer Commentaries - The Mummy (2017),Andy this is how I did it : I was expecting a bad movie and it was beter than thats
UcbFg__aMvA,Honest Trailer Commentaries - The Mummy (2017),"I'm surprised they don't talk more about how this is the 2nd attempt to launch the Dark Universe. The fact they already failed once with Dracula Untold, to me is a huge deal meaning that there's no way they try a 3rd time."
UcbFg__aMvA,Honest Trailer Commentaries - The Mummy (2017),"That's ""Bedazzled"" not ""Bedeviled."""
UcbFg__aMvA,Honest Trailer Commentaries - The Mummy (2017),"There's one scene I couldn't forget. It's where Tom Cruise fights off one of the mummy-zombie things underwater. When he defeats the zombie, the actor playing as the zombie paddles his feet so that it looks like the zombie is sinking. I know that underwater fight scenes are difficult to do but if you can't execute it properly, what's the point? If the zombie has enough energy to paddle away from Tom Cruise, then he has enough energy to paddle towards Tom Cruise."
UcbFg__aMvA,Honest Trailer Commentaries - The Mummy (2017),I haven't seen the movie yet guys im tempted not to but im interested now I feel I should see it just to align my thoughts with your views
UcbFg__aMvA,Honest Trailer Commentaries - The Mummy (2017),Still no Shirtless Spencer Gilbert?
UcbFg__aMvA,Honest Trailer Commentaries - The Mummy (2017),i think i saw dan's beard physically grow throughout the act of revisiting this movie
UcbFg__aMvA,Honest Trailer Commentaries - The Mummy (2017),"Andy, you should know the answer to your question. It's the same situation where everyone from SJ likes the fast and furious movies that are stupid and unwatchable, but somehow everyone likes it and making excuses that those movies are fun and have good action scenes."
UcbFg__aMvA,Honest Trailer Commentaries - The Mummy (2017),"yes you guys are right 
i did turned off my brain to get through the movie"
UcbFg__aMvA,Honest Trailer Commentaries - The Mummy (2017),"How did i enjoy this movie ?! Firts i got drunk, second it was raining and third the theater chairs were awsome !! I slep half the time. Great !! Love it !"
UcbFg__aMvA,Honest Trailer Commentaries - The Mummy (2017),Thank God I saw this movie on 123movies😂. I would've been pissed if I spent money on this crap😂😂
UcbFg__aMvA,Honest Trailer Commentaries - The Mummy (2017),The hate for Into Darkness is so confusing to me. I thought that the majority consensus was overall positive.
UcbFg__aMvA,Honest Trailer Commentaries - The Mummy (2017),"I sympathize with Andy I hated the mummy 2017 too.Uninspired,bland,and forgettable just like Rogue 1&Episode 7.Episode 8 is next to get axed."
UcbFg__aMvA,Honest Trailer Commentaries - The Mummy (2017),10:47 I don't see why people don't get it. The tattoos were a sign that she had pledged to the devil. The devil gave her a knife to seal the deal with blood. Then the last thing she need was to kill someone to let the devil into their world where she would marry him and they would live for ever in a world of death. Those tattoos and knife were basically like a contract
UcbFg__aMvA,Honest Trailer Commentaries - The Mummy (2017),Cruise is 50 years old and thinks he's 20.... still fans? Really ??
UcbFg__aMvA,Honest Trailer Commentaries - The Mummy (2017),"bedazzled was the name of the movie, lol"
UcbFg__aMvA,Honest Trailer Commentaries - The Mummy (2017),I loved the movie
UcbFg__aMvA,Honest Trailer Commentaries - The Mummy (2017),Just put the Brendan Frasier cast into a new monster movie. I'd watch that.
UcbFg__aMvA,Honest Trailer Commentaries - The Mummy (2017),"What I don't understand is why they didn't just start with Dracula Untold?  That was an ok, fun movie!  And the original plan was to start with that, but that plan got scrapped for this?!"
UcbFg__aMvA,Honest Trailer Commentaries - The Mummy (2017),"The whole 'dark universe' concept is complicated - they want two combine two elements: a modern version of a story from the 19th century, like Sherlock, and create a universe with the gothic characters, like in 'penny dreadful'. And they want to do it simultaneously. 
But nevertheless, I still believe it's possible. If someone really, really talented has a good idea for this dark universe."
UcbFg__aMvA,Honest Trailer Commentaries - The Mummy (2017),These ad placements are the worst.
UcbFg__aMvA,Honest Trailer Commentaries - The Mummy (2017),"I was actually confused when this one got such terrible reviews haha. It's fairly dumb Hollywood fun, but it's still fun. I'm not sure what people expected walking in, but to me I never expect big budget Hollywood movies to be overtly smart...so I already walked in knowing to turn off my brain...I dunno, call me crazy but I enjoyed it."
UcbFg__aMvA,Honest Trailer Commentaries - The Mummy (2017),Since Dracula untold was supposed to start the dark universe review Dracula untold
UcbFg__aMvA,Honest Trailer Commentaries - The Mummy (2017),"This is by far the worst movie, I can't even. I don't remember anything that I liked of this movie. The Brendan Fraser Mummies were soo good (the first 2) this one physically hurts us. I still don't understand what happened to Tom Cruise's character. The actual mummy was decent but she tried her hardest. The action in this movie isn't even good.
Edit: Also why can't they just say who Mr Jeckel and Hyde was you can't just put this in the movie and be like hey you should already know who this guy is. That is incredibley presumptuous. If u wanna build a universe tell us who the nick fury of the Group is."
UcbFg__aMvA,Honest Trailer Commentaries - The Mummy (2017),This is amazing! Haha
UcbFg__aMvA,Honest Trailer Commentaries - The Mummy (2017),Are these videos available on Screen Junkies Plus or are these commentaries a new thing? I hope they are a new thing they do for every honest trailer cause this was great.
UcbFg__aMvA,Honest Trailer Commentaries - The Mummy (2017),Chris Kattan? Now that's a Bojack Horseman reference innit?
UcbFg__aMvA,Honest Trailer Commentaries - The Mummy (2017),I say the Mummy movies 1999 and 2001 was good !
UcbFg__aMvA,Honest Trailer Commentaries - The Mummy (2017),"I despised this movie, it was truly terrible, however, the score by Tyler Bates is actually way better than it has any right to be for a movie like this. I would encourage giving some of the main themes a listen, and forgetting the movie they come from exists."
UcbFg__aMvA,Honest Trailer Commentaries - The Mummy (2017),"the movie was fine, not great but not as bad as these guys are making it out to be."
UcbFg__aMvA,Honest Trailer Commentaries - The Mummy (2017),Thanks for saving me those 2 hours guys!
UcbFg__aMvA,Honest Trailer Commentaries - The Mummy (2017),So do they like Dracula Untold better or worse?
UcbFg__aMvA,Honest Trailer Commentaries - The Mummy (2017),"I need to watch the Brendan Fraser Mummy movie again, it's gonna be a Blast From The Past. ;)"
UcbFg__aMvA,Honest Trailer Commentaries - The Mummy (2017),Now i'm glad I never saw this monster train wreck of a movie. Hmm...could a literal 'monster train wreck ' save this Dark Universe?
UcbFg__aMvA,Honest Trailer Commentaries - The Mummy (2017),Great impressions; 'd like to see more of those ;-)
UcbFg__aMvA,Honest Trailer Commentaries - The Mummy (2017),Does Joe still work at SJ?
UcbFg__aMvA,Honest Trailer Commentaries - The Mummy (2017),I prefer Dracula Untold a 100 times than this movie.
UcbFg__aMvA,Honest Trailer Commentaries - The Mummy (2017),It definitely wasn't a good movie.
UcbFg__aMvA,Honest Trailer Commentaries - The Mummy (2017),"I enjoyed this movie. I had heard the worst reviews for it, I expected it to be terrible. But it was better than expected. My expectations were so low. Tom Cruise's sidekick was without question the worse thing."
UcbFg__aMvA,Honest Trailer Commentaries - The Mummy (2017),"Watched the movie while playing MTGO. Atleast the game was enjoyable.
Didn't feel it was horrible but it was so dumb and pointless... Guess cuz I barely payed attention to it."
UcbFg__aMvA,Honest Trailer Commentaries - The Mummy (2017),Please beg Brendan to return to an Egypt based Mummy
UcbFg__aMvA,Honest Trailer Commentaries - The Mummy (2017),I thought this movie was hilarious. It's adorable to see a studio fall flat on its face with making a cinematic universe.
UcbFg__aMvA,Honest Trailer Commentaries - The Mummy (2017),"No Brendan Fraser,  no fun."
UcbFg__aMvA,Honest Trailer Commentaries - The Mummy (2017),TWO YEARS YOUNGER. crowe is TWO years younger than cruise
UcbFg__aMvA,Honest Trailer Commentaries - The Mummy (2017),"Watching through this movie I thought it was dumb, but honestly didn't think it was terrible...until the ending. The ending was so poorly thought out and executed, it was a spectacular crash and burn. I feel like this movie would of scraped through being passable if they had stuck the landing."
UcbFg__aMvA,Honest Trailer Commentaries - The Mummy (2017),I would prefer these honest commentaries if you toned down the volume of the trailer so we can actually hear what you guys are saying.
UcbFg__aMvA,Honest Trailer Commentaries - The Mummy (2017),"Hi, Screen Junkies. I love work you doing, i have fun watching your videos. And, Andy, i liked this movie. I saw it during fantasy and sci-fi ""Festival Fantazie"" (small con) here in Czech Republic for ca. one quarter of regular price for ticket, so this was one plus. I knew it was a bad movie, so i had no expectations. And i saw it after Great Wall, that helped too.
I love Tom Cruise. I like Russel Crow. And Sofia Boutella is hot as f***. I loved ""PG-13 bandages"" and ""tatooos from devil"". I knew about heavy exposition beforehand, so it did´nt bother me that much. And i may have weird sense of humor, but i laughed a lot. (Funniest scene for me was when Cruise was under mummy at that altair and that stupid Dr. frozed in doors and Cruise called her name and she was like ´What?´and he ´Run!´ Well and that Book of the Dead cameo.)
Overall i know it´s bad movie. But i don´t find it unenjoyable. That Damsel in distress was annoying, but movie itself did not drag for me and festival´s atmosphere in cinema was great. It´s something else when it´s full of fantasy/sci-fi geeks. :) So, yeah, i get where is Andy and others coming from, but i am not movie critic and i have lots and lots guilty pleasure movies. This will be one of them. Hell, my best friend unlike me loooooooves Transformers, Gods of Egypt and Pirates, so my taste is not that bad. :)"
UcbFg__aMvA,Honest Trailer Commentaries - The Mummy (2017),"Fraser's movie is a very good film, it's a Classic.  Entertaining films can be good too like BTTF and so many 1920s references"
UcbFg__aMvA,Honest Trailer Commentaries - The Mummy (2017),"i think the deal was about making her immortal or something and the ""jargon"" thing wasn't just about hieroglyphics, it was because the girl kept on saying jargons right after he finishes his sentences. and yeah, i watched the movie just because i had nothing else to do"
UcbFg__aMvA,Honest Trailer Commentaries - The Mummy (2017),"I ""enjoyed"" it because it was free and I was drunk. I didn't watch it as a horror movie, I didn't watch it as a universe movie... I just watched it and thought it was a fine action movie. It's better on Mute."
UcbFg__aMvA,Honest Trailer Commentaries - The Mummy (2017),"Please, lower the trailer volume. We want to hear the commentary, we already saw the trailer."
UcbFg__aMvA,Honest Trailer Commentaries - The Mummy (2017),This is one of those movies where I watched it and just didn't care either way. I don't hate it. I don't like it. But it does exist and I've seen it.
UcbFg__aMvA,Honest Trailer Commentaries - The Mummy (2017),"In Tom criuise you swer to tom cruise NOT Batman.

That's the only reason I find. Yep.. Tom Cruise Cardio"
UcbFg__aMvA,Honest Trailer Commentaries - The Mummy (2017),i couldnt enjoy seeing tom cruise getting flung around with no real consequence to the jostling about lol also like every single movie monster these days they build the mummy all powerful killing people with a single touch until she comes to our protagonists and she just throws them instead of killing them. it was just bad for the sake of bad lol
UcbFg__aMvA,Honest Trailer Commentaries - The Mummy (2017),Russel crowe was the best thing about the movie
UcbFg__aMvA,Honest Trailer Commentaries - The Mummy (2017),"A mi me gusto, la película no fue buena pero tampoco estubo tan mal y me pareció graciosa la pelea final con la momia #kurtzmanSucks :v"
UcbFg__aMvA,Honest Trailer Commentaries - The Mummy (2017),do the raid redemption honest trailer before im dead
UcbFg__aMvA,Honest Trailer Commentaries - The Mummy (2017),I thought Angelina Jolie was set to play the Bride of Frankenstein
UcbFg__aMvA,Honest Trailer Commentaries - The Mummy (2017),"I love these Honest Trailers commentaries, as well as everything else you guys do. 🖒"
UcbFg__aMvA,Honest Trailer Commentaries - The Mummy (2017),The commentary is sometimes more funny than the trailer. Partly because watching these idiots for the passed 2-3 years I've grown accustomed to their antics.
UcbFg__aMvA,Honest Trailer Commentaries - The Mummy (2017),". . . this """"movie"""" don't deserve even a commentary . . ."
UcbFg__aMvA,Honest Trailer Commentaries - The Mummy (2017),I agree with everything you said...but bottom line it made money...and as long as that happens this crap will keep happening.
UcbFg__aMvA,Honest Trailer Commentaries - The Mummy (2017),"I swear I kept reading Andy Signore's shirt as ""Apple Jakkoffs""....."
UcbFg__aMvA,Honest Trailer Commentaries - The Mummy (2017),Dan continues to bless us with awesome impressions. His Tom Cruise is amazing
UcbFg__aMvA,Honest Trailer Commentaries - The Mummy (2017),sofia boutella!! that how i watched the movie
UcbFg__aMvA,Honest Trailer Commentaries - The Mummy (2017),"I loved The Mummy and The Mummy Returns. When they announced this one I was so afraid they are going to rehash them. I have never been more grateful to see a movie suck so badly cause it makes the other two look so much better. I would be lying however, if I said I wasn't a little bummed that this movie wasn't a little bit good. I would have liked to see the Dark Universe. After this movie however I can no longer trust Universal."
UcbFg__aMvA,Honest Trailer Commentaries - The Mummy (2017),"The Brendan Fraser Mummy movies weren't that good either, sorry. They weren't horrible but not that good."
UcbFg__aMvA,Honest Trailer Commentaries - The Mummy (2017),Spencer looks so happy in the thumbnail of this video! Whoever is doing the thumbnails for these recent videos with Spencer in them is doing a really good job and is bringing a smile to my face with these awesome thumbnails! And I really enjoyed this Honest Commentary and the Honest Trailer was really funny!
UcbFg__aMvA,Honest Trailer Commentaries - The Mummy (2017),"Such a dumb movie. Had no idea what it wanted to be genre wise, just a mess!"
UcbFg__aMvA,Honest Trailer Commentaries - The Mummy (2017),"Dan, why are you advertising the nasty Aspartme-filled Diet Coke?  That crap is not good for ya'.  As for the film, the first preview turned me off and then all of the negative reviews just made me stay far, far away from this turd ball."
UcbFg__aMvA,Honest Trailer Commentaries - The Mummy (2017),wheres joe starr??
UcbFg__aMvA,Honest Trailer Commentaries - The Mummy (2017),I might be really stupid because the movie sounds so silly I kinda wanna watch it. It also may be that I'm scarred from the selection ofLars von Trier movies I've had to watch for school over the weekend...
UcbFg__aMvA,Honest Trailer Commentaries - The Mummy (2017),Did they just forget to tell Joe they were filming
UcbFg__aMvA,Honest Trailer Commentaries - The Mummy (2017),"So the she was upset she was been replaced with a baby because it was male. To recover her rightfull position of power, she becomes a servant to a god,a  male god, fells in love with it and passes the eternity trying to bring the it to Earth so entity could rule the world, and herself. Ok.... girlpower?"
UcbFg__aMvA,Honest Trailer Commentaries - The Mummy (2017),The Mummy with Fraser WAS a great movie  :)
UcbFg__aMvA,Honest Trailer Commentaries - The Mummy (2017),I really don't get the point of the unnecessary shot at the intelligence of homeschoolers tbh love you guys but that was really cheap
UcbFg__aMvA,Honest Trailer Commentaries - The Mummy (2017),"at best it will be later looked back as the ""phantom menace"" of the dark universe. starting universes is becoming as failing as starting sitcoms was back in the early 2000s"
UcbFg__aMvA,Honest Trailer Commentaries - The Mummy (2017),"I can't believe you didn't tell the director, in regards to the Fraser cameo, to ""have an Inkheart""."
UcbFg__aMvA,Honest Trailer Commentaries - The Mummy (2017),"Dan's Impression of Russel Crowe and Tom Cruise at 12:28
Dan is the Daniel Day Lewis of Screen Junkies"
UcbFg__aMvA,Honest Trailer Commentaries - The Mummy (2017),Wait Tom cruise screamed someone back to life ?? Isn't that just like hulk screaming iron man back to life
UcbFg__aMvA,Honest Trailer Commentaries - The Mummy (2017),I really liked the last 20 mins of the film when cruise became evil it was cool seeing it phantom of the opera-ey and badass with the sandstorm
UcbFg__aMvA,Honest Trailer Commentaries - The Mummy (2017),"I appreciate that this view will be unpopular, but I actually didn't think it was that bad.

Since you asked for 'why' some people enjoyed it, here we go. Bear in mind that the films I love are ones like Arrival and Usual Suspects and I'm not a complete moron :D

Yes, it failed spectacularly at setting up a wider universe, and every mention of something that wasn't actually beneficial to the plot (e.g. Mr Hyde) felt forced, but it wasn't as bad as Batman V Superman or Amazing Spider-Man 2. Yes, it was incredibly generic; generic bad guy with generic powers and generic action hero with generic stunts and generic locations. None of the acting was phenomenally outstanding nor was it particularly awful.

It wasn't as cheesy as the original Mummy films, nor as funny, but it wasn't supposed to be.

They wanted to bring Jekyll and Mummy and Frankenstein and Dracula together and wanted them to be in that 'generic action film' bubble. So they brought in Tom Cruise, Mr Generic Action Hero himself. Have you watched the last few Mission Impossible films? Have you watched Knight And Day? Have you watched Jack Reacher 1 & 2? They're the same stunts, the same look and feel, the same acting, basically the same CHARACTER, but they're all enjoyable action films. This was a ""Tom Cruise film with a Mummy twist"" not a remake of the Mummy. 'Tom Cruise runs a lot, preferably away from explosions' is the mission statement.

So I found it vaguely enjoyable - mission impossible but with ancient Egyptian mythology vaguely draped across the top of it, with some big set pieces and some good female Mummy bad guy thing going on.

Did I think it was spectacular? No. But it's a bit harsh to attack it THIS much for being an average bland action film. Did it make me want to watch the rest of the universe? No. But that was never going to happen. Did I think it was a great Mummy remake? No. But it wasn't supposed to be. Did I think it was a pretty generic Tom Cruise film that had supernatural stuff over the top of it that didn't really make sense but then none of his films do and at least this was more interesting? Yeah a bit. I'm not even sure a 'good' Mummy film is really feasible - it has to be camp and cheesy and we're not really in that place in modern cinema anymore.

But yeah stop making shitty universes with generic films. This was better than Transformers 5 or Amazing Spider-Man 2 or BvS or F8Furious - but this is a mid range film with no real expectations compared to those juggernauts so I just don't understand the sheer volume of hate you guys have for this film... it was just a dumb action film, pitched a little too dark and generic to actually work, end of discussion lol"
UcbFg__aMvA,Honest Trailer Commentaries - The Mummy (2017),"I can't find when the video starts, pls help"
UcbFg__aMvA,Honest Trailer Commentaries - The Mummy (2017),"A better version of The Dark Universe is just Penny Dreadful, it has Dracula, werewolves, Dorian Grey, and a bunch of other good gothic characters.  If they went with a feel more like that, it would have worked better."
UcbFg__aMvA,Honest Trailer Commentaries - The Mummy (2017),So are we getting the Wonder Woman Honest Trailer soon? And can you bring Patty Jenkins aboard to reflect any anti-DC comments you guys might have?
UcbFg__aMvA,Honest Trailer Commentaries - The Mummy (2017),"I knew this movie would be bad going in, but I had no idea just how bad. I actually found it too boring and convoluted to even serve as a good hate watch."
UcbFg__aMvA,Honest Trailer Commentaries - The Mummy (2017),MORE AUSTRALIAN ACCENTS!!! Love it :D
UcbFg__aMvA,Honest Trailer Commentaries - The Mummy (2017),"To answer your question, I liked the film mostly because of the Mummy herself. She's a very cool bad guy. I also liked a lot of the comedy and I liked how they tried to twist around some of the concepts, like Dr. Jekyll needs to take his drug to stay Jekyll. As for the DARK UNIVERSE! I just hope they don't scrap this one and then try to reboot it again. Like they've tried this DARK UNIVERSE idea like 4 times now and they can't just restart it over and over again and act like we can't remember all the other times they tried it. Either actually keep it going, or actually give up. Make up your mind."
UcbFg__aMvA,Honest Trailer Commentaries - The Mummy (2017),"I enjoyed it
it was a fun dumb movie"
UcbFg__aMvA,Honest Trailer Commentaries - The Mummy (2017),"The Mummy wasn't great, but as I watched the movie texting majority of the time I found the action scenes to be fun and liked Russell Crowe's over the top zaniness. The best way I can describe The Mummy is that it is a perfect movie to watch while editing or doing something else to distract you long enough for a short break, but then mediocre enough to resume your project. After watching the Honest Commentaries for both Kong Skull Island and The Mummy I have to say I have the opposite opinions on these movies. You guys make great points, but at the end of the day I guess it just comes down to personal preference when looking at extremely average studio mandated films."
UcbFg__aMvA,Honest Trailer Commentaries - The Mummy (2017),"I will say that, as an armature writer, I was ok with this movie. I don't remember anything from when I watched it so my brain probably shut off during it, but I remember leaving the theater with a feeling of ""this is ok"". I probably will never see it again but I'm optimistic about the dark universe, mainly for the fact that one of my favorite movies is the creature from the black lagoon."
UcbFg__aMvA,Honest Trailer Commentaries - The Mummy (2017),Oh my god its Russell Crowe! Oh my god meh meh blah blah blah lol
UcbFg__aMvA,Honest Trailer Commentaries - The Mummy (2017),Tom Cruise has the best scream ever!
UcbFg__aMvA,Honest Trailer Commentaries - The Mummy (2017),"I just wanna see Crowe as Jekyll/Hyde, he was the only redeemable thing. I turned my brain off, but even turned off, nothing worked for me. It was like eating Saltines over and over."
UcbFg__aMvA,Honest Trailer Commentaries - The Mummy (2017),#throwhimamonkeybone
UcbFg__aMvA,Honest Trailer Commentaries - The Mummy (2017),I just turned my brain off and enjoyed Tom Cruise' antics. Enjoyed this far more than POTC in fact.
UcbFg__aMvA,Honest Trailer Commentaries - The Mummy (2017),I think the thing is people realize this movie wasn't that good but somehow someway they were able to find some enjoyment In the film .
UcbFg__aMvA,Honest Trailer Commentaries - The Mummy (2017),9:40 - 10:10 funniest part of video
UcbFg__aMvA,Honest Trailer Commentaries - The Mummy (2017),"Funny thing is, the movie said Amunet sold her soul to Set, the god of death. Set isn't even the god of the dead in Egyptian mythology! Yes, Set was not a good guy, but Anubis was the god of the dead. Yet, the movie made a point of telling you he was, indeed, the god of death. My inner Evelyn O'Connell went crazy, and it just furthers the point that so little effort went into this script."
UcbFg__aMvA,Honest Trailer Commentaries - The Mummy (2017),"To me this film really was entertaining, you know guys not every new release has to be The God Father or Mad Max. The Mummy was dumb, but it was also fun."
UcbFg__aMvA,Honest Trailer Commentaries - The Mummy (2017),This was more entertaining than the movie.
UcbFg__aMvA,Honest Trailer Commentaries - The Mummy (2017),Please do Edge of Tomorrow
UcbFg__aMvA,Honest Trailer Commentaries - The Mummy (2017),"I think you guys don't understand the hieroglyphics part. It wasn't that he didn't know what they were, it's that he was freaking out and at that moment he didn't care for her correcting what he said because it wasn't relevant in the moment.

But this movie still has plenty of other really dumb stuff in it."
UcbFg__aMvA,Honest Trailer Commentaries - The Mummy (2017),"I didn't hate this movie for the single reason of I constantly heard how ""awful"" it was before seeing so i went in with extremely low expectations and left not hating...its not good but ill probably at least give the next movies in the universe a shot...granted i see almost everything that comes out though haha."
UcbFg__aMvA,Honest Trailer Commentaries - The Mummy (2017),"The actual action pieces in the film are good. Both Cruise and Boutella are good in key action moments but everything else in between was awful. I went to see it partly because of Cruise but as a Star Trek fan I was keen to see more of Sofia Boutella. Here's me foolishly thinking the person playing the title character would have good screen time! Both her and Cruise could have done so much more I feel, yet the script was so weighted down by world building it just went nowhere. That being said, it has put me off going to see her in future roles or indeed Cruise once he's back in solid action films."
UcbFg__aMvA,Honest Trailer Commentaries - The Mummy (2017),"honestly, i was able to turn off my brain cause it was tom cruise and ive never seen any other mummy movie."
UcbFg__aMvA,Honest Trailer Commentaries - The Mummy (2017),I seen it in theaters and I really hated so much I went to sleep until the movie is over and I old universal classic monster films damn you Kurtsman you ruined the monster universe
UcbFg__aMvA,Honest Trailer Commentaries - The Mummy (2017),The Mummy didn't flop people need to stop saying it did
UcbFg__aMvA,Honest Trailer Commentaries - The Mummy (2017),"The mummy in the movie was interesting. Jekyll/Hyde was fine, but the main characters were dumb and the story was shitty."
UcbFg__aMvA,Honest Trailer Commentaries - The Mummy (2017),i love dan doing impressions
UcbFg__aMvA,Honest Trailer Commentaries - The Mummy (2017),Actually it's pronounced Fray-zer not like the show Frasier.
UcbFg__aMvA,Honest Trailer Commentaries - The Mummy (2017),I liked the movie because I thought of it as a tom cruise action film with monsters in it and not so much as a mummy movie cause when you think of it as that it sucks
UcbFg__aMvA,Honest Trailer Commentaries - The Mummy (2017),DO STARHIP TROOPERS!!! I'VE WAITED LONG ENOUGH
UcbFg__aMvA,Honest Trailer Commentaries - The Mummy (2017),"As one of the few who enjoyed it, I can admit it's not a good movie. But Tom Cruz and Nick from New Girl were entertaining. I thought scene where Tom is trying to escape in the truck, but drives right back to the Mummy was a cool little sequence.

Over all not a good movie, but I don't think it was bad enough to destroy the future franchise"
UcbFg__aMvA,Honest Trailer Commentaries - The Mummy (2017),"the mummy 1999 version was really good i love that film, this movie wasnt bad, but its also pretty bad, i guess, i didnt mind, i still like the 1999 version so much yet to see the christopher lee version."
UcbFg__aMvA,Honest Trailer Commentaries - The Mummy (2017),"I can't believe you didn't mention that Set is not even the god of death. Like, come on screenwriters! All you had to do is google that shit!"
UcbFg__aMvA,Honest Trailer Commentaries - The Mummy (2017),These Guys  vs  Roth
UcbFg__aMvA,Honest Trailer Commentaries - The Mummy (2017),"a really bad movie which mascarades as a mediocre movie thanks to a 150 million $ make up. this sucked so hard, a dracula movie would be at this point just redundant."
UcbFg__aMvA,Honest Trailer Commentaries - The Mummy (2017),"Those Dan impressions are the best lol 
Also, ""serial killer's calling card"", lmao! XD"
UcbFg__aMvA,Honest Trailer Commentaries - The Mummy (2017),Gambit still happening though...
UcbFg__aMvA,Honest Trailer Commentaries - The Mummy (2017),"To be honest the movie is bad. But I still enjoy bad movies. I think (and i know that's your job) you lose the excitemen of just going to the movies to have fun and if the movie isn't good you just don't enjoy the time. Remember that movies are all about experience and having a good time, of course a good movie helps a lot (like 80%) but it's not only about that."
UcbFg__aMvA,Honest Trailer Commentaries - The Mummy (2017),I think they're trying to do a series that's like The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen meets Hellboy and that just can't end well. Also I think your end card is broken
UcbFg__aMvA,Honest Trailer Commentaries - The Mummy (2017),"I loved watching the Mummy (1999) when was a kid, and I think it has aged really well. The tones were well balanced: a little comedy here and there, romance and adventure, some horror elements (the disgusting bugs going inside people's bodies...). Why is it so hard  for movie executives/producers to understand that it's better to put your best effort into one movie, that the audience will feel for and then (maybe) after a while give them a second adventure? How ignorant and shallow must they be in to make movies like this?"
UcbFg__aMvA,Honest Trailer Commentaries - The Mummy (2017),"I watch while doing other stuff, that way you don't pay too much attention and just enjoy the background noise"
UcbFg__aMvA,Honest Trailer Commentaries - The Mummy (2017),The only good part about this movie was Russel Crow
UcbFg__aMvA,Honest Trailer Commentaries - The Mummy (2017),"Hey Andy, Wife and I loved the original Mummy and Mummy Returns. Enjoyed them a LOT. We watched this going in knowing it was not going to be good. But we actually found this to be fine for some reason, put it this way, we thought the movie was actually OK. I fully recognize a ton of eww moments and there really is a flaw in the plot, but I think we just turned our brain off and it was fine to the point of we enjoyed it. Even now I feel as if I didn't waste my time watching it and am left with a ""It's really not that bad"" feeling.

I really think expectation helped here, we totally thought this was going to be a dumpster fire, but left feeling it was worth seeing, despite the MONUMENTAL amount of exposition and forced narrative of a ""Dark Universe""..."
UcbFg__aMvA,Honest Trailer Commentaries - The Mummy (2017),"Box office: 407.8 million USD
Budget: $125 million"
UcbFg__aMvA,Honest Trailer Commentaries - The Mummy (2017),"I thought that it was 'meh', but I'm easily entertained. It's probably hard for you to 'turn your brain off' since your job is to do the exact opposite."
UcbFg__aMvA,Honest Trailer Commentaries - The Mummy (2017),"I enjoyed the concept that they started and wanted to see the universe actualy work, I liked the movie and Screen Junkies did catch all of the bad stuff, the execution killed it, they still have a chance to recover i think and continue on the path they have set."
UcbFg__aMvA,Honest Trailer Commentaries - The Mummy (2017),Dan's Russell Crowe and Tom Cruise impression 😂😂😂
UcbFg__aMvA,Honest Trailer Commentaries - The Mummy (2017),The Mummy 1999  vs  The Mummy 2017
UcbFg__aMvA,Honest Trailer Commentaries - The Mummy (2017),i thought the movie was OK... not great but just OK.
UcbFg__aMvA,Honest Trailer Commentaries - The Mummy (2017),You know why I like Screen Junkies? For becoming like a mainstream media company like CNN - they make a commentary show based on their own production. It's awesome!
UcbFg__aMvA,Honest Trailer Commentaries - The Mummy (2017),"A pleasure to watch, as always."
UcbFg__aMvA,Honest Trailer Commentaries - The Mummy (2017),Agree with Dan Murrel about The Mummy (1999) plus you have an incredible score by Jerry Goldsmith
UcbFg__aMvA,Honest Trailer Commentaries - The Mummy (2017),"I'm a little confused, having not seen the movie. Not sure seeing it would have helped though.

Which Egyptian god is involved? Their most important death god was Osiris, who was considered very much not evil."
UcbFg__aMvA,Honest Trailer Commentaries - The Mummy (2017),"""We're giving this too much thought""
A phrase that was never uttered once during development.

Also any chance you guys can get the control over pausing. Whoever is in control of the pause button should be pausing when you talk, regardless of whether you say ""Pause"". When there is cross talk between Jon and the three of you I can't hear what ANYONE is saying."
UcbFg__aMvA,Honest Trailer Commentaries - The Mummy (2017),The movie isn't as bad as you make it out to be
UcbFg__aMvA,Honest Trailer Commentaries - The Mummy (2017),The Mummy (2017) is better than Transformers Andy
UcbFg__aMvA,Honest Trailer Commentaries - The Mummy (2017),I was really looking forward to this adaptation of the Mummy... im upset that it was such a mess. bloated P.O.S.
UcbFg__aMvA,Honest Trailer Commentaries - The Mummy (2017),Give me Fraser any day !
UcbFg__aMvA,Honest Trailer Commentaries - The Mummy (2017),It was a remake of Lifeforce by people who didn't know they were remaking lifeforce. Nor could they live up to Lifeforce and its nude female vampire destroying London. That's what was enjoyable about it. The film itself wasn't any good but spending all that money to unintentionally remake a seemingly coked up 80's Cannon-Tobe Hooper film was great to see.
UcbFg__aMvA,Honest Trailer Commentaries - The Mummy (2017),"Despite some problems I had (some of which you pointed out), I actually enjoyed the movie. I still prefer the first Brendan Fraser one though."
UcbFg__aMvA,Honest Trailer Commentaries - The Mummy (2017),7:25 Alcohol Andy alcohol.......
UcbFg__aMvA,Honest Trailer Commentaries - The Mummy (2017),"What would've been cool is if they made Tom cruise a monster slayer who has a history with slaying monsters (like it's been a job passed down in his family), and then he was the hero trying to stop the mummy; but while he was doing his thing trying to stop the mummy, he runs into the Russell Crowe secret organization and they team up or they have their differences and he disagrees with some moral they have, and then they can base the next movies on new monster villains or someshit. Something along the lines of what I just said would be a better movie than what they put there if done correctly, even tho it sounds kinda unoriginal and overdone. But hey maybe they could've put their own twist on it, made it fun and enjoyable. Literally anything else would've been better than what we got."
UcbFg__aMvA,Honest Trailer Commentaries - The Mummy (2017),"Never seen it. Thought it had a sliver of promise, that promise died."
UcbFg__aMvA,Honest Trailer Commentaries - The Mummy (2017),"While there were moments of annoyance, especially with Jake Johnson, The Mummy has cool, fun scenes.  Emphasis on scenes.  The plot is not that great strung together, but the scenes of mindless action were enjoyable.  I went in with extremely low expectations, and by the end, I didn't have a horrible time."
UcbFg__aMvA,Honest Trailer Commentaries - The Mummy (2017),Did Spencer lose a bet? He's on all the thumbnails lately
UcbFg__aMvA,Honest Trailer Commentaries - The Mummy (2017),Hated this movie! The villain was good though
UcbFg__aMvA,Honest Trailer Commentaries - The Mummy (2017),"""Monster Squad"" is a classic masterpiece!!"
UcbFg__aMvA,Honest Trailer Commentaries - The Mummy (2017),"Low expectations let me actually enjoy it, I didn't expect ANYTHING!! And I got some cool visuals and Tom Cruise"
UcbFg__aMvA,Honest Trailer Commentaries - The Mummy (2017),"I found the film enjoyable for its potential rather than its action scenes, which were mediocre. I liked the fact that they teased the shared universe, which admittedly they went overboard and I wish they'd have left the Hyde transformation out of this one. It worked better as a set-up for better movies along the way."
UcbFg__aMvA,Honest Trailer Commentaries - The Mummy (2017),You gotta get really high
UcbFg__aMvA,Honest Trailer Commentaries - The Mummy (2017),"I really enjoyed everything up to when the Mummy escapes, the lore seemed pretty cool. The whole Egyptian devil possessing him now was a little blah and he can already control his powers? Come on! Save that for the sequel 😉"
UcbFg__aMvA,Honest Trailer Commentaries - The Mummy (2017),Where is Joe?
UcbFg__aMvA,Honest Trailer Commentaries - The Mummy (2017),"I didn't like the movie, but I found Cruise and Crowe enjoyable in it."
UcbFg__aMvA,Honest Trailer Commentaries - The Mummy (2017),This Movie was Gahbage.....
UcbFg__aMvA,Honest Trailer Commentaries - The Mummy (2017),I would love to see the honest trailer guys make a video where they try to rationalize the entire movie. This was a great commentary!

This is the best Honest Trailer made too date IMO.  It just gets better the more you watch it.  Please, please do more of them.  BTW, Botnik is not a ""robot"", it's an A.I. program.

Don't get me wrong. I'm amazed at how you pieced a video together for a script like this. But this isn't what we asked for nor what I expected when I clicked on this. This feels like a bait-n-switch. First video from you guys that I'm actually down-voting on your site. SMH. Terrible."

FLcADSgRBx4,Honest Trailers Commentary - Honest Trailers Written By A Robot,"You should use Botnik to make movie scripts for all the major movie/tv franchises, just like the Harry Potter chapter it wrote. You can make a new Avengers, Star Wars, Lord Of The Rings etc. I’d like to see that."
FLcADSgRBx4,Honest Trailers Commentary - Honest Trailers Written By A Robot,"Here's a fun game: Everyone copy and paste all your YouTube comments into a text file and then upload the file to the Botnik app and then create the robot version of yourself! Post your robot comment below. Here's the robot's version of me: ""Expanding on what Spencer utterly destroyed, this perspective entails humans using spoilers based purely on YouTube's depravity. I think Moviepass will improve directors because they wear their struggles on kids that are indistinguishable from merchandising. I'm just pasting fans who disliked recaps without controversy. In my opinion, selling nostalgia appeals to audiences that discuss mature, pretty, philosophical villains. The problem is humans tend to be disturbing female superheroes with disability. But weirdly, when Disney pulls represented groups, malnutrition stereotypes literally and ironically eventuate."""

FLcADSgRBx4,Honest Trailers Commentary - Honest Trailers Written By A Robot,"I mean, it was hilarious even though it made zero sense. But it kinda shows that all honest trailers are just mad libs? Or the writers just settled into a fixed format of writing honest trailers even beyond the sequence of just the skeleton of honest trailer. The video editing was friickkng amazing! 
It was a fun watch"
FLcADSgRBx4,Honest Trailers Commentary - Honest Trailers Written By A Robot,"So the robot came up with words but people changed them...Ok then. It didn't write the script. (4:36 "" A team of four writers..."") A guy named Johna came up with Mike Potions as a name, not the robot. Human's did and tried to make it sound like a clumsy robot...? Why not just have the bot just present the entire dictionary and the human writers pick whatever words on that list in whatever order they like for the purpose of the project? That's writing. Humans wrote this. The robot named words then people changed them out. If the first draft was edited by a robot, ok. But people wrote this trailer based on an interpretation of the format by their bot which people completely rewrote. So lets see the robots first, heck even second draft. Saying the bot wrote this is like me saying I wrote this trailer because prior to this I also have written the name Mike and used the word ""the"". What did the robot write? Thats what I want to know."

FO8XZ4uBQKk,Honest Trailers Commentary | MCU,"35:11 I’m watching Infinity War right now and one thing I noticed near the beginning is in a shot of Manhattan under the new World Trade Center you can see the World Trade Center Memorial where one of the two original towers were. So apparently the September 11th attacks happened in the MCU. I think its safe to say the MCU is a universe nearly identical to ours up until the events of Iron Man. After that, as they pointed out, the events of the movies become major world and universe events, and things like pop culture and politics change as a result. Obama and Fortnite apparently still are part of the MCU though, even if according to Iron Man 3, Obama never became president."

FO8XZ4uBQKk,Honest Trailers Commentary | MCU,"I'm amazed you guys didn't cover the thirst scenes.

FO8XZ4uBQKk,Honest Trailers Commentary | MCU,"Joe Starr is correct about the origin of the Marvel comics relaunch of GI Joe.  Hasbro wanted to make toys again.  However laws said you could not use a TV show IE cartoon to sell toys to kids.  However it did not cover using a comic book to sell toys, or to advertise the comic book on TV.   Hasbro then went to Marvel.    Marvel had this idea of Nick Fury vs Hydra comic on the table.  So Marvel had Larry Hama reskin that Nick Fury idea and called it GI Joe."
FO8XZ4uBQKk,Honest Trailers Commentary | MCU,"Just a girl could not be a worse choice for that scene in Captain Marvel. If the movie were R I'd say ""I don't give a fuck"" by Boss would have been perfect for the feel of that scene."

FO8XZ4uBQKk,Honest Trailers Commentary | MCU,"My all time favourite trailers are probably “Les Miserables” (a movie I loved) and “The Notebook” (a movie I hated).  Thanks for starting to do the commentaries:  they’re even funnier than the trailers!  However, I hope the commentaries don’t become a way of addressing the critiques of the comments section now that both won’t be posted at the same time.  I’d rather hear the story of your own experience of creating the trailer."

FO8XZ4uBQKk,Honest Trailers Commentary | MCU,"Ok @Joe @Lons No Doubt in Capt Marvel is in the right song-moment, but its impact is wrecked by the music excess earlier on. For example there are 2 water-metaphor songs that play during the “find a secret base in the desert” sequences. If you want that trick, play 1 Oasis track & it’ll do the same job in a less jarring way. Instead we get Garbage & TLC because female vocalists and an instruction that this is Carol’s internal jukebox now she’s back on Earth. Its painful by the end because the music selected just hits the same beats again & again. The film’s track-list is classic 90s, but even on paper its a crap dj set, as the songs selected serve the construction of our protagonist’s psychology instead of telling a powerful story, which what a good music set will help you do. Wow I finally worked out what hurt about that, thanks."
FO8XZ4uBQKk,Honest Trailers Commentary | MCU,We need to talk about Kevin.
FO8XZ4uBQKk,Honest Trailers Commentary | MCU,Ego was not a good villain Red Skull was much better and as a bonus not dead.
FO8XZ4uBQKk,Honest Trailers Commentary | MCU,"#17:10 @Lons I found Vikings for you.   Vikingsonline org uk they have living history weekends not just mock battles. I’m sure they’d engage with you on that article as many are big mcu fans. Their numbers include historians & archeologist, some are full-time smiths & traders, you accrue prestige in that society for the authenticity of manufacture of your clothes, tools, tents etc. In someways they are an ultimate fandom and media savvy. How do you thing a TV show not on HBO can get a Viking or Saxon army whipped-up in a summer?  That’s not say some haven’t been walking the walls if Winterfell & Castle Black for 8yrs ;)"

FO8XZ4uBQKk,Honest Trailers Commentary | MCU,Kevin is me in every social gathering. Happy to be there but not much to say coz I'm busy paying attention to what everyone else is saying.
FO8XZ4uBQKk,Honest Trailers Commentary | MCU,"I do love (what is now) Fandom and everything you guys do or are involved with... but... the points you make about not doing ""cinema sins"", these are ""trailers"" and everything else you guys do to make Honest Trailers their own thing (something amazing we all love) - are all things I feel the current Game Trailers need to take on board more (I know they're their own thing and maybe only Spencer works on them sometimes(?); it seems relevant with you guys bringing it up here), I do love the game trailers, especially as a gaming nerd, but they feel more like Honest Reviews, very rigid and formulaic (early days too I guess maybe?).

Just hopefully constructive criticism from a guy who literally does nothing but watches all your amazing content to get through the day :') Keep it up guys this trailer and commentary was awesome!"
FO8XZ4uBQKk,Honest Trailers Commentary | MCU,Waterworks next week?
FO8XZ4uBQKk,Honest Trailers Commentary | MCU,@Joe Starr with a Plinkett reference? “It’s gonna be great.”
FO8XZ4uBQKk,Honest Trailers Commentary | MCU,I have been using a trackpad for almost 10 years and have been using the gestures since then. In fact I set the trackpad on the left side of my mac keyboard and use the mouse for pointing and clicking. I also use the 4 finger pinch on iPad so I don't wear out the home button. Learning gestures shouldn't be a problem for me. Probably the only thing hard about the new gestures is getting used to using 3 fingers to pinch and zoom.
FO8XZ4uBQKk,Honest Trailers Commentary | MCU,Lon just blew my mind

FO8XZ4uBQKk,Honest Trailers Commentary | MCU,Age of Ultron is the weakest Avenger movie but they talk about it like it’s Thor 2 or Iron Man 2. Hell there are moments that are better than the first avenger movie. Everything at the farm and everything at the party is pure gold along with that opening scene.
FO8XZ4uBQKk,Honest Trailers Commentary | MCU,"I love you, Joe. After that BTS reference, I love you even more."

But after seeing your awesome Captain Marvel trailer I'm happy you guys aren't holding back joking on a bad movie lol.

1. I reject your insinuation that there are no deep cuts in the GOTG soundtracks. As someone who listened almost exclusively to classic rock before I got a good data plan, I had never heard several of the songs on these albums (sidebar: this also means that the eventual nostalgia cash-ins for this decade won't bother me because I don't listen to a lot of modern music anyway.)

FO8XZ4uBQKk,Honest Trailers Commentary | MCU,"Love to Kevin, great job brother"
FO8XZ4uBQKk,Honest Trailers Commentary | MCU,"Disney took over MCU distribution before Avengers 1. Contractually Paramount's logo appeared on Avengers and Iron Man 3, but Disney distributed both of those. 



But Marvel Studios is still the production house. Paramount (and Universal for Incredible Hulk) just had a distribution deal, so the creative continuity was unbroken from the outset. The difference between distributor and creator can best by seen now by the Spider-Man movies, which Marvel makes so it fits in the continuity, but Sony distributes it to theaters and home video per its ownership rights.


Disney later acquired Distribution rights back to Iron Man, Iron Man 2, Thor and Captain America FA, for home media distribution. Universal still controls Incredible Hulk home video rights but Disney can use it for boxed sets and such."
FO8XZ4uBQKk,Honest Trailers Commentary | MCU,"8:13 I'll be ""that guy"" in a couple ways.  First, I'm commenting before the video ends, and second, I know there's a huge difference between the Norse Pantheon of the Prose Edda and Poetic Edda (of historical verbal legend and the contribution Snorri Sturluson) and Jack Kirby and Stan Lee's comic book characters, but here we go.

Odin has several children, so Thor has many siblings. Hela (or Hel) is not one of them, nor is Loki for that matter.  Loki is actually Odin's blood brother in that they both cut their wrists and shmushed their gross wounds together (I guess the Aesir and Juten don't fear God-AIDS), thus making Loki Thor's uncle if anything.

Hel/Hela is actually Loki's illegitimate daughter, as was Fenrir/Fenris Wolf, the big wolf she was petting in Thor: Ragnarok, as well as Jormungundr, the Midgard serpent.  

In conclusion, Thor's biological brothers are Baldr, Vithr, and Bori (and possibly more identified by Sturluson, but unconfirmed by other traditional sources). Loki is Thor's (kind of) uncle, Hela is his cousin, and I am a know-it-all douchebag who likes to listen to lectures on YouTube, read some Neil Gaiman, and acts like some kind of scholar on the matter when in fact I'm just some grease monkey in Southern Oregon with no college education and barely made it through high school.  Also Thor is supposed to have red hair. See? I can't even help myself. Are you still reading this? At this point it's on you. You're an enabler. I hope you're happy with yourself."
FO8XZ4uBQKk,Honest Trailers Commentary | MCU,« I’m just a girl » really upset me when it hit. I was like... really not subtle. It felt really stupid to me. But that’s just my opinion
FO8XZ4uBQKk,Honest Trailers Commentary | MCU,Hey Kevin! You’re awesome! Nice to meet you!
FO8XZ4uBQKk,Honest Trailers Commentary | MCU,"This is an amazing trailer and an hilarious commentary. I can tell you guys are so talented and work so hard. You always go above and beyond and rarely/if ever take the easy way out. 
I noticed Kevin didn't say much. Maybe he's a little camera shy. If he's up for it I would love to see him more.
Congrats for 300 trailers and here's to 300 more!"
FO8XZ4uBQKk,Honest Trailers Commentary | MCU,"my fave honest trailers....... in no particular order..... zootopia, lion king, boss baby"

FO8XZ4uBQKk,Honest Trailers Commentary | MCU,"Spencer Gilbert or.......
Sketch your guilt-bert"
FO8XZ4uBQKk,Honest Trailers Commentary | MCU,"Actually, mentor/relative deaths were not part of the Lee/Kirby model.  Iron Man and Captain America kind of had it, but it was such  a quick part of those original comics, that no emotional weight was given to them until years later.  Fantastic Four didn't have that, Hulk didn't, Thor didn't, Ant-Man didn't, etc.   When Black Panther came along, his father was already long dead."
FO8XZ4uBQKk,Honest Trailers Commentary | MCU,You know what heroes DO have a sex life? DC heroes! Remember Superman and Lois Lane in the bathtub? Wonder Woman and Steve Trevor at the hotel? Batman and that random chick when he woke up from a nightmare? Nite Owl and Silk Spectre in Watchmen? BOOM! DC is cooler!!!!!!!
FO8XZ4uBQKk,Honest Trailers Commentary | MCU,Maybe you guys could do a compilation HT of all the really great movies that people request that you feel would be hard to do and then just do a mash up?
FO8XZ4uBQKk,Honest Trailers Commentary | MCU,"Yondu's arrow is not a combo, a combo is two characters combining for an attack ala Ultimate Alliance."
FO8XZ4uBQKk,Honest Trailers Commentary | MCU,"Oh man I like Kevin! He didn't talk enough though, we couldn't get to know him much :/ He needs to be in front of the camera more often so he can get more confident and lose some of the tension :))"
FO8XZ4uBQKk,Honest Trailers Commentary | MCU,"I hear a lot of confusion over the planets and other ""space"" stuff in the MCU.

Basically: There are a shitload of species and habitable worlds in this galaxy. The Asgardians conquered 8, those (+Asgard) became the nine realms (from the Thor movies), which were connected with the Bifrost, also called the rainbow bridge. Earth is one of them, together with Muspelheim, Svartalfheim, Jotunheim, Nidavellir…

All other worlds are not connected to the Bifrost, so you need a spaceship to go there and there are hyperlanes as well (Guardians 2) and wormholes (Thor 3, Sakaar is surrounded by them), so worlds like Xandar, Hala, Knowhere, Vormir, Titan etc. are travelled to that way.

On that note: Its a bit weird, that Heimdall can see and talk to Thor while he's on Sakaar, as it's not part of the nine realms. Heimdalls power is connected to his sword, which can summon the Bifrost, so it should be contained to the nine realms."
FO8XZ4uBQKk,Honest Trailers Commentary | MCU,"SEDUCTIVE GOD OF THUNDER, get it right Lon."
FO8XZ4uBQKk,Honest Trailers Commentary | MCU,"Rule of thumb is you get there first, you get to name it."
FO8XZ4uBQKk,Honest Trailers Commentary | MCU,"I wish Kevin said more, I was very interested to see his imput and opinions since we only hear about him and never seen him . I mean I get why he didn't. Maybe he is camera shy because he's never been in front of the camera. 

The commentary was great btw, it's always very fun"
FO8XZ4uBQKk,Honest Trailers Commentary | MCU,Finally!
FO8XZ4uBQKk,Honest Trailers Commentary | MCU,"What trailer is ""something very wet ""for next week?"
FO8XZ4uBQKk,Honest Trailers Commentary | MCU,The famous Kevin!! Great <3
FO8XZ4uBQKk,Honest Trailers Commentary | MCU,Finally the man behind the scene 👏👏
FO8XZ4uBQKk,Honest Trailers Commentary | MCU,"I'm still hoping there will be a redo of the Agents of SHIELD honest trailer, not because it's bad but because they most likely didn't watch the whole show (unlike the other tv trailers). Apologies if I'm wrong."
FO8XZ4uBQKk,Honest Trailers Commentary | MCU,So basically Doctor Strange is Ego

O7a10a_D8nE,HONEST TRAILERS MOVIE FIGHTS ROUND 1,"Mixed in with a lot of nostalgic love is the white hot crusading force for justice: Harvey Dent. He may not have the REALLY nostalgic appeal of Lincoln or the Farleyness of Callahan, but in the scope of his backstory (and I'm not super into the comics, so I'm going by the Pervasive Nolan Standard (PNS) pronounced correctly by academics and research psychologists as [pee-n] - [uss), a hallowed law of popular culture by which a film maker, writer or sometimes actor will groove so hard to their own jam they miss the memo of whats trending and basically do as they will. In Nolan's case he was able to give us Harvey's story which showed how much he had done for Gotham City. The Dark Knight and The Sun Also Rise-s suggest that in the time between Two-Face's death and when we rejoin Limpin' Bruce Pimp eight years later on the rooftop overlooking the party AND THAT PRICK COPS A FEEL ON CATWOMAN?? He so desrved what he got. Anyway, the Commissioner (Gordon) wants to tell the truth about Harvey, but not before he acknowledges the amazing work they've able to do by ""Giving law enforcement teeth"", and essentially all jerking into a mason jar and throwing it on each other about how great Harvey was not only as a pillar of the community but a person able to affect amazing changes WITHOUT WEARING A MASK (as Batman says) . To summerise: Harvey Dent is my favourite movie lawyer. His one prominent scene was so underplayed and all but forgotten about after Joker [Applies insensitive racial stereotype of Tyler Perry as the Mama] ""throws some a dat context up in da fraaaame... Ooooh Luurrrrrd!"" We see Harvey in full DA mode disarm a dude with an Italian last name (Eric Roberts isn't even Italian, but he pulls off the Bawss role perfectly because he's just that greasey (I can say that because my Great Great Grandad on my Dad's adopted side may have lived in Naples). The way he's obviously shaken but seems to have a good understanding of what he's signed up for leads the viewer to believe, and Nolan does this in almost every project he's involved with, We're feeling feelings while we watch a film like TDK or BB that you don't have when you watch Man of Steel or Superman IV or A Serbian Film (if that's a headspace you feel like being in). Atticus Finch was a great film Lawyer because he stood up for the downtrodden, as was his sweet nature, and we watched that over 129 mins until his arc went back to one. In the Nolan Batverse (and anyone inside PNS will back me up. If there's one thing that makes us happy it's when the PNS stands tall against a slippery slope and finds a way inside all of us. At once) we are confronted with what Nolan may refer to as his ""Artistic Expressionism through Writing dense narratives around different fundamental emotions we all have (In chronilogical order...) Fear, Chaos and Pain. And if you go back to Memento through the Prestige, Inception and Interstellar, the confusion itself is the motivator, not necessarily the characters either, we as audience members are sucked into vaguely themed worlds where uncertainty rules. I truly believe his handling of Two Face in TDK was so rich coming from the page and acted by Aaron Eckhart and directed by one of the writers? That's why it's so dense. He's a lawyer for the good guys and he cleaned up Gotham like a Clint Eastwood sherriff in the late 1800's, or if you prefer the classic Dirty Harry with it's incredible take 4 mil against 36? Bruce Willis and company could never blow it out like that and they have brand awareness and nostalgia on their side. To quote you wonderful writers; ""Die Hard as a revenge movie in and around Central Park in 1970"" was a gritty feel. We love Harvey Dent because he's a good guy and he makes a difference, a lot of hero movies stomp on the story until the script details that he/won, but not entirely...Automatic Sequel. Well if you made it this far; Spencer J. KILLBERT (RAWWWWRRR) and Joe ""That is also my name!"" Starr thanks for your arguments (Lincoln won out of the two of you)... But ""Damn Daniel (rockin' the white VAAAAANNS)"", as a two acrobat show (Steven Speilberg or Batman depending on whether the audience feels really old or ARE really old) I expected a little more ""Face-Time""... Did any of you consider Harvey as the crusading, good to the last drop kinda American hero Gotham, if not every other city in the Free 52, could only hope to wish for. If it wasn't for the Joker he would never become TF and as an audience I feel it reflects our hope (actually the underlying focus of Shawshank Redemption but more on that in my next overly long discussion piece on my favourite channel on YouTube). Dan I thought you were going to rep Gotham... But I guess I was wrong :(      

I'm just playin' but thanks to another great piece of content. I love all you guys.

Jon if you can say ""Mimeticpolyaloy..."" with Arnold's Terminator voice.... Dude...

O7a10a_D8nE,HONEST TRAILERS MOVIE FIGHTS ROUND 1,It is a shame that Dan really didn't get to use the Jedi mind trick as a closer for how Obi-Wan is the best movie character as a lawyer
O7a10a_D8nE,HONEST TRAILERS MOVIE FIGHTS ROUND 1,Dan is the Man!
O7a10a_D8nE,HONEST TRAILERS MOVIE FIGHTS ROUND 1,"""One owl, forget it! Two owls, now you're talking!"""

O7a10a_D8nE,HONEST TRAILERS MOVIE FIGHTS ROUND 1,What more do we have to do as fans to have these three legends fight it out again? It never fails to be an amazing fight and so damn hilarious at the same time!
O7a10a_D8nE,HONEST TRAILERS MOVIE FIGHTS ROUND 1,The proper answer to the Val Kilmer question was his character from Real Genius.
O7a10a_D8nE,HONEST TRAILERS MOVIE FIGHTS ROUND 1,Nobody chose Atticus Finch or Matt Murdock?

O7a10a_D8nE,HONEST TRAILERS MOVIE FIGHTS ROUND 1,Joe's grudge was the best part of my day
O7a10a_D8nE,HONEST TRAILERS MOVIE FIGHTS ROUND 1,"I have seen the title and was a bit confused, like are they going to argue about best honest trailer or what? Best jokes in honest trailers? And then I remembered that these 3 guys make honest trailers lol"
O7a10a_D8nE,HONEST TRAILERS MOVIE FIGHTS ROUND 1,Let's be honest here... Hal is a lot better at hosting Movie Fights than the other guy could ever hope to be.
O7a10a_D8nE,HONEST TRAILERS MOVIE FIGHTS ROUND 1,When are you bringing Kevin Smith back? We need Kevin vs. Dan.
O7a10a_D8nE,HONEST TRAILERS MOVIE FIGHTS ROUND 1,Joe Starr's Internet movie pitch sounded great to me.  I'd pay *CASH* to see it.
O7a10a_D8nE,HONEST TRAILERS MOVIE FIGHTS ROUND 1,"I don't understand how Dan yells fix and gets a rematch . It's so toxic, he is hypocritical, he is yelling white male that he claims to hate. The women in film event was such a nice fundraiser but he had to complain that Spencer got too much time to talk and then Spencer didnt win so he had to complain about Hal judging twice. I know he has lots of fans so giving into him is beneficial, but its really jarring hearing him complain about the vitriol on the internet and people taking movies too seriously when he will move heaven and earth to win  this pointless fixed show and throw his toys out of the pram when he doesn't. I just wish he could watch himself back and start holding himself to his own standards and just chill. Everyone should just be excellent to one another and that includes being a respectful loser."

O7a10a_D8nE,HONEST TRAILERS MOVIE FIGHTS ROUND 1,"Oh yeah, dope. This is Movie Fights. I was kinda sick of the more annoying contestants/guests in the previous episodes. There were a few there that were just super frustrating to listen to. Great return to form. Dan is my absolute favorite."

O7a10a_D8nE,HONEST TRAILERS MOVIE FIGHTS ROUND 1,"1) Assuming he is my ally, Professor X.
2) If it counts, the possessed girl in the original exorcist. Otherwise, Dan's.
3) My pitch would take too long, but basically a film about how a man becomes an agent of karma by mapping his brain digitally and being everywhere all at once via the internet. Total gratification of bad people being exposed, thieves getting stolen from, good people getting help, etc.
I'd have picked Oldman's character in 5th element in the speed round. True Lies, Val Kilmer's character from Real Genius as a washed up hippy, and Dr. Strange because of the trippy potential with animation."

O7a10a_D8nE,HONEST TRAILERS MOVIE FIGHTS ROUND 1,"For a long time I wanted to ask you, Why are you in such a hurry? You're always ending the rounds too early. Is it because you can use the studio for a limited time? Or you have to go back to work?

O7a10a_D8nE,HONEST TRAILERS MOVIE FIGHTS ROUND 1,I think Hal should bring back closing arguments. I noticed he hasn't been doing it over the past few movie fights.

O7a10a_D8nE,HONEST TRAILERS MOVIE FIGHTS ROUND 1,I love Hal he is super funny but it really annoyed me that he just skips over giving them each a closing argument for each round so at most only one person each round gets lucky and gets a last minute shot in instead of each of them getting a quick closing statement for why they are right and the others are wrong

MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"One problem I have with Logan is that if the whole movie is centered around Logan trying to defend the young girl from the evil villains than why does she seem to be fully capable to taking care of herself. I don't get the feeling that this is a character who is weak and worthy of being protected. No this kid is badass, she murders people like a lunatic and nobody seems to be able to hurt her. That's my biggest gripe. Other than that it is a good movie."

u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Logan is full of cliches and tropes.

THANK YOU! I've been saying that since it's release. Logan is a great movie. But unique/different/challenging? No sir."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I want to dispute the first round. I vote that Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2. is the best superhero movie of the year. Also, my god. We had 10 superhero movies this year, didn't we?"

u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,I would see that predator/Pirates movie in a heartbeat!
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,I would actually really like a Pirates/predator movie but I think the predator would be camouflaged most of the movie
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Ragnorak makes a few sly references to the prison industrial complex, and Logan has refitted the message of the X-Men to put in a new repressed group (immigrants, especially MX immigrants) to symbolize what used to be Jewish-ness, LGBTQA, and other persecuted groups (since one person is supposed to be Malcom X, one MLK) so both are poignant films in some way, which is rad. The original X-Men had Jewish people expiermented on (like real life) and Logan had latino women experimented on (like real life.)"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Like for the montage!!!
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I'm liking a new format but I feel like it could benefit from a third fighter. From all the movie fights I've seen, Dan and Spencer tend to be a couple of the stronger combatants, but it can't always be this equally matched, and one-on-one increases the likelihood of a total slaughter."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I thought this was fantastic!  Your arguments were amazing, and I loved that we had time to really argue, but that it was also concise and quick paced!  I’m looking forward to the New Year!"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Have you thought about making it 2 on 2, a tag team Movie fights?"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I don't like the new format with only 2 competitors it eliminates the vibrant discussion and argument, show doesn't flow the same, there is no organic chaos that i loved."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Dan is right about Ragnarok and Spencer is right about Logan ergo Wonder Woman is the best of 2017.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"drop the 2 girls on the couch and the fan vote, add another fighter and polish the visuals a bit and this will be good. I won't even watch the next episode, because when there are only 2 fighters it is very hard to ignore the annoyance of some people in your ""squad"""
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,I think Logan was the best superhero movie but i dont agree with Dan  that the people who didn't saw the prequels will appreciate it that much
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Imagine tropical island, sunset, one pirateship sinking and other escaping towards the sunset. And on the beach under a palm tree predator is sitting, wearing a piratehat, drinking rum ( already drunk af), taking piratedreadlocks as trophies, shooting blunderbuss at nothing and with other hand carving the skull out of the body next to him which is Jack Sparrow."

u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I liked this and am happy Movie Fights is back!!! However, I think three fighters worked better. You should also get MatPat from Film Theory on here!!! <3"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Im sorry but my first thought was to check the time...because theyre standing, how long are they going to stand for? ""Oh its an hour, maybe after the intro they'll sit"" they didnt, I think i stopped watching because i felt bad. I liked the vibe it had before where it felt like friends passionately arguing and making a point for their answer, and i was just invited in to watch but now a lot of that comfort and freedom seems to be gone? Its more like going into school to watch the debate team. I understand you cant please everybody, and things had to be different to make a point, but was there really a person who voted for less players and no chairs?"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Liking the new format, a lot less people talking over each other or debates getting out of control with two fighters, which is good as some fighters were pretty shouty, although I think you're gonna have to be careful to get fresh people on plenty with one less fighter.
That said, a couple bits of feedback on it:
* I think you really should have made Dan go first on the sabotage question, as he got to have first choice of his opponent's argument, (the rationale of making the person arguing the first answer go first was to even out the advantage slightly) he can always take a few seconds to think before starting. It's sticking the boot in to have the person who answered second have to start first on those.
* We should also hear from the presenter/host even when their vote is moot to the final decision, just so we know if it was 3-0 or 2-1, and also because they might have relevant thoughts that will sell the audience more on the decision if it is 3-0, or placate those of us who disagree when it's 2-1.
* I'm undecided on whether the audience having a vote on the main questions is a good idea or not- I think sometimes the audience got it right when judges didn't in the past, but that overall they're probably less reliable. That might be something to consider in this new format, especially as there's nothing to prevent the live audience voting with an agenda.
* You're gonna have to be much more careful about having even matchups in a 1v1 format. In a 1v1v1, it's not a huge deal if one of the fighters is outclassed as long as another can keep up with the leader, so hopefully you'll either be careful to put newer fighters against each other, or come up with a sort of tournament structure for rating them."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,I like this new version of movie fights.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"HUGE mistake to have only two fighters. It doesn't allow for dynamic fighting, like where one fighter has to choose to argue against one or the other and ends up helping the others case. There's just less structural drama."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,19:23 what was the movie mention ? I didn't understand
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,U need 3 contestants. and add some celebs :D
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Bring the table back and sit down! You are making me nervous, you look like politicians :P"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"What is just happening???

Are you expelliarmus or something???"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Not feeling it. :(
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,FINALY!!! Thank you! Great!
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Please find a way to make tag team matches!
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I liked the 3 person part of the old fights. More people! That being said, the new question format is better. 3 judges is a good idea."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"The poll thing is a bad idea. Just hearing the choices, I would've voted Logan immediately and I guess a lot of people did too because they're all projecting a lot of their frustration on Logan not getting noms from awards bodies by voting Logan. After hearing the arguments, I chose Spencer. He had a lot more jabs on the movie. So yeah... no to the polls because it's hard to distinguish if the person voting is biased or actually listening to the arguments."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I think I prefer 3 contestants and guests, The best thing about this particular fight was the way the asking of questions to keep everything moving."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Glad to see it back.  It's what got me I to screen junkies and than schmoesknow.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Love these geeks!
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,LOGAN basically ripped off MIDNIGHT SPECIAL.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Bring back 3 fighters. Hal is a great host, keep him."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Y'all are great and I don't want to be negative, but I agree with others that it feels a bit lower energy and a bit less fun. Those will be challenges to overcome in the future."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I second the general comments. Three people fight is better, and just let them sit :)"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Awesome fight
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Logan has moments of levity...
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Hate it. Need 3. New host. No trick questions.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Thoughts
1. I like Al as the judge (good at being impartial and keeping things on track)
2. Prefer 3 competitors (a little more interesting for both question options and responses)
3. Prefer Joe Star as fact checker (Roth is just too nice and wants to mommy everyone) 
4. Glad you are bringing Movie Fights back."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Really did not like the judging in this game
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Spencer should've won that third question.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Just needs refining, but it’s a great format"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Only one movie fights since it reboot...great (sarcasm intended)
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,We need a bell
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Hal is amazing host. Funny, well spoken, giving great additional questions."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,I want to see Zootopia/Diehard!!! Sounds awesome. I would not want to see that pirate movie.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I appreciate you guys trying to change up the format, but honestly this isn’t very good. There was a certain energy about the last format. At the very least I think three fighters should come back. I like having multiple judges though."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Drunk Movie fights is much more fun !
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Not a fan of the new format. 3 fighters is better and it just feels so formal and corporate now rather than a bunch of friends debating about movies. Also take away the poll mattering. People aren't going to ever vote for the arguments. They are going to either vote for the movie or person they like better. Also dear god the shitty CNN overlay. Ugh.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I like the new format, look, montage! I just wish you'd get more than 2 contestants. The 3 dynamic was great, made for a lot more debate and humour."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"OK! It's still moviefights, in many ways. Loving Gilbert not mincing words, whether I disagree or not. But yes, 3 fighters for sure."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Definitely different from the old Movie Fights, but honestly with everything these fine folks have been through recently, I'm willing to give this a chance and watch it routinely. Before we know it, this will feel as familiar as the old format for sure."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Pre-made minds...
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"First off.... SO GLAD MOVIE FIGHTS is back!!!! I hope that they can entertain going back to the 3 player format.  Love all of the changes, but sometimes a player could have a off day, and the other two players end up saving what could have been a weak episode.  Also the third fighter can even out the validity of the question.  Once in a while there could be a wayyyyyyy of the wall answer that if in a two player format might not pan out well.  Standing up I agree with a lot of the other comments to stiff and ridged.  Love the more casual sit down.  A place to place the belts, water or drinks.... Glad to see you guys all back though....its been wayyyyy to long!  Happy New year Screen Junkies team!"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Why does the Matrix Reloaded/Revolutions get so much hate? Also, best movie starring James Franco? THIS IS THE END! Helloooo..."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"You're back, I'm back...I really missed Movie Fights."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I like the new format, much better than three people yelling at the same time. Also like the three judges."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Do it by sitting down on a V shape desk. It more friendly or intimate that way rather than standing up like jerk fighting for their position on Washington DC.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Great montage!!
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Good to see you back.. Some notes: New set looked too cold and stressfull, also give them CHAIRS! Loved the rest^^"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I don't dislike this format, but I believe that the 3-fighter variant is better. Perhaps find a way to include both?"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,No offence to dan or Logan but I was rooting for Spencer
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"if you decide to have the constant graphics, then i would suggest to also add the picks of the contestants"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,You need 3 fighters that variance is needed. Don't mind the 2 judges and a tiebreaker but at most the audience should be the tiebreaker if included at all.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,No one likes Roth
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Yay! I am so glad it’s back!!!
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Ragnarok wasn't all that good. It was trying too hard to be Guardians of The Galaxy and ruined any chance for a propper Planet Hulk series.

u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,I enjoyed this but I prefer the more relaxed atmosphere of the old movie fights much more. I don’t understand why they had to change the format.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,The fact that Spencer won the crossover fight boggles my mind to no end.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Please do a movie fights of best movie of 2017!!!
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,I watched Logan 8 times :)
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Great to see Movie Fights back. I prefer the three panel approach in that players can bounce off each other. In a 2 way fight, you hear very little agreement, as opponents butt heads. It also offers more opinions and thoughts to each question."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,You should do a coco trailer
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Have the competitors sit. Bring back 3 competitors, it brings a lot more energy and hilarity. I love Hal as the new judge but I enjoyed having a judge that had all the power unless power was delegated to others by the judge. But I do think that this will work when Dan is in the position of giving points because he is very experienced in movie fights and what makes a good fight (as he has judged movie fights before)  #bringbackthebell"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I'm happy to have Movie Fights back, and hope we get many more fights to come.  I think having the contestants sit down in a more relaxed environment is better than having it in what looks like the elevator shaft of a hotel in Soho...  The 3 person format was better, but 2 person isn't bad if you have good fighters like these two.  I like having more questions, with a shorter time to make arguments...  Hal asked a lot of questions to steer the debate, and I didn't mind that.  Hal did a great job."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,I'm so glad to see this show is back!  I know you wanted to move past the old show but please don't throw the baby out with the bathwater.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I would've chosen Guardians 2 over Ragnarok, it has a better balance between levity and gravity"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"This setup is so bland, I miss the big desk w chairs and mics and the figures on the table. This space seems abit congested and even having the categories on the side it just feels less fun overall. Also need 3 fighters obviously although I'm sure it's tough to get everyone together for movie fights these days since everyone is getting more successful (busy) in their own careers."

u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"The fan poll is probably the only thing I really don't like.  We saw on the old show that the polls tended to be about popularity and name recognition and not the arguments.  Heck, I'll even admit to voting in polls to episodes I hadn't even seen yet, since I'm not usually able to watch live."

u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I liked 3 fighters as well, but I suspect it’s a lot easier to keep episodes to an hour with only 2. I know that’s something MF always struggled with."

u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,I also think bill from The Life Aquatic would have made a more decent jedi. The ones who persevered and prosperd under his ways were ultimately worthy of his ways. Only one disciple was lost and only to the cause. Worthy sacrifice in the name of prosperity.

u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"This new format sort of  lost the spirit of Movie Fight. It felt cold, uncomfortable and unfriendly to me. Hal, Dan and Spencer are great as always but the stage feels out of place. :D"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Spencer could have won the first round IF he chose a better movie, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2. Why does everyone think Thor is better, when Guardians is funny AND has a great story? AND has Baby Groot? And MARY POPPINS???"

btw 3 players were better.

u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Hal is a great host and I always enjoy watching Dan and Spencer but it'd be better if everyone was seated like before and if the third vote wasn't the poll because that's less about the arguments than just a third judge's opinion. Also I really hope Drunk Movie Fights and Classic Movie Fights return!
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Don't give Disney any ideas Spence, we don't need a Zootopia sequel. In fact, we don't need one at all. Still hated that movie. But I will go for a Pirates of the Caribbean/Predator crossover, I'm with you on that one Dan."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Hal is a fantastic host and it's amazing to have Movie Fights back and better than ever!
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Yeah, is Chris Nolan directed a Star Wars movie, it would probably one of the best ones ever made, easy."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Spencer has an issue with conceding points to his competitors.  Never concede anything in an argument.

In the first fight he concedes that Logan is a better movie.  And in the second argument he makes a strong point that Dan pitched a Pirates movie without Jack Sparrow but then immediately undercuts his point by saying that ""yeah, people dont want to see Johnny Depp anymore."""

u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"The way Hal brought on those questions really spiced things up (like, ""who would be a better Jedi teacher?""). I think it'd be a better idea to get those small segway questions from the chat or from Twitter. That way, we on Twitter can feel like we're actually affecting what's going on in the fight. Thanks and more power to all of ya!"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Please bring back the old format and as much as hal wasn't as annoying as a host find a better host. Roth or alicia. Someone please!
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,I really dislike this new scoring
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"PROS:
- Hal hosting is great.
- Extra judges makes it seem more fair and less controversial with decisions.
- New intro montage might be my favorite yet.

CONS:
- Three fighters is way more fun.
- No commercial break for Spencer to go poop."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"logan, Deadpool, wick, wonder woman,  thor,  moana   basically rated R  thru  rated G etc"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I like the 3 fighter version best. Everyone sitting down felt much more casual and each person was more relaxed and the arguments had heated moments in it which was part of the excitement , as opposed to this which feels more like a presidential debate"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"1. Great hosting
2. Love 3 judges
3. Visuals are good
4. (The only negative) I feel it still needs 3 debaters. With 3 we would always get an amazing idea, an ""oh that would be cool"" idea, and a ""wow, where did that come from?"" Idea. This was missing the 3rd, which always was the most fun to me. 

Still great to see this on again though! You guys are the absolute best to listen to while trying to survive the work day!"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Remove the overlay during the fight please. :) Bring it up after rounds, maybe once or twice to show the score you know!"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"@screenjunkies You should do the, “Which director working today would make the best Star Wars movie?” as a real question. There are so many working today that make would AMAZING Star Wars movies. Dennis Villanueva (sp?), Guillermo Del Toro, Patti Jenkins, Christopher Nolan, James Gunn, the Russo Brothers just to name a few."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Movie Fights seems better as a wrestling match and not a Republican vs Democrat debate.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I didn’t like the new format at first but it grew on me, I think it achieves what you’re going for in that it’s meant to be a game. Didn’t like the scoring being a consensus though, I still think the host should have final say. And twitter polls shouldn’t count officially since a lot of people may just vote for their favorite when it pops up in their twitter feed and they may not even be watching the show and listening to the arguments. Just my $0.02. Glad to see it back and Hal made a great host!"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? - MOVIE FIGHT unnecessary.

Logan.

Without any doubts"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Thx for coming back! Great overhaul overall ! However, I agree with some other fellow comenters: the 3 fighters formats brings in a more dynamic show. Maybe you could vary, sometimes aving 2 sometimes having 3. 
The 3 way judging was pitch perfect. Congrats!"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"The old format sitting down felt more like friends chatting, the podiums really don't work..."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Honestly a mixed bag of good and bag changes. Like Hal as the host and letting teh fans vote for who won each round is a good change. But having them stand behind podiums steals how laid back the old show was. Seems less comfortable. Also it was better with 3 panel guests instead of 2.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Loved this show before, it was one of my favourite things on youtube. Still great, maybe just get at least 3 fighters and maybe try a table so everyone can sit."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"It was ok. Not sure I'd tune in regularly. The elevated theatricality is what MADE the show. It was like pro wrestling with movie references. Most everyone understood it was showmanship. 
Lately Screen Junkies has gone soooo far out of their way to negate any edges. It's a little snoozy now."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I love Hal as the presenter, hope it's long term! I preferred the old montage though tbh..."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Hey guys! Glad to see you back with Movie Fights!!! Just my two cents as a long-time fan: I'm ok with the new format (the set does need work though - it's a bit too formal...what happened to the good old days with all the geeky action figures and movie memorabilia?), and I, like most people on here, seem to like everyone sitting down rather than standing up. But meh, those are small things. 

The questions and arguments are still as good as ever!  I hope Roxy will be coming back with TV Fights as well - can't wait to see how she & Billy fare with the new setup (I'm sure they will be awesome, as always).   Can't wait to see the next episode! :)"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Did Hal Rudnick play the drunk cabby in Crocodile Dundee?
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,While they are listening to the viewers I personally never ever liked when all the fights became live streamed instead of recorded  still one of my favorite channels and I think they'll bring back three fighters eventually
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I love that you guys constantly want to improve and are not afraid of changing things up, bravo! I do think though that the one on one “game show” was a little off brand and that more debaters in a more casual setting is better. Not being too negative though as I’m glad to see it back and it’s always a pleasure watching Dan and Spencer fight! 👍👍"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Nice format guys. 
I think I prefer the sitting down and 3 fighters format better though. It was less formal and more collected."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I understand the need to completely revamp this show. I prefer the new set, because all those screens that absolutely showed nothing but the logo always, always bothered me to no end, what a waste of screens. I do think if you are going to go this route, it should now be titled, Movie Debates. 

Having three fighters was always a little chaotic, people talking over each other, I don’t know how one judge ever figured out what they were saying and then when they did not, it was dullard episode. 

I never liked the previous judge, he now clearly in the light is a terrible person altogether, but he was just an inconsistent “judge.” And it was always a thrill when somebody else guest judged. I think the host should rotate out always. 

I am commenting on this just upfront before I watch the full thing because I don’t know when I’ll finish. I just wanted to say that I’m glad it’s back, I’m glad it’s different. It still needs a heavy dose of energy, but I think by keeping it shorter, a lot shorter, this is a massive improvement."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"For what it's worth, if anything, I think the podiums/standing's gotta go. It just looks more like a formal debate, which is fine, but it sucks a little bit of the fun out of it. Just my two cents"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I've never commented before but 3 fighters makes it more interesting and fun... also i think you guys should sit gives it a more relaxed feel, this feels to formal ... Hal is a great host   ... good job with taking risks ... all the best to you guys... also be nice to have fans watching the show live again :) I want to be one of them :)"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"So glad it's back. I really loved this show, I'm glad it wasn't killed by Andy's issues. Hope to see this show continue (though i do agree with some of the criticisms)"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Good to see the guys back. The new format is a bit too formal and I miss the 3 fighter format.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"The dynamic of three fighters is necessary, the back and forth of fighters agreeing with each other sometimes creates more of a friendly atmosphere instead of the more formal debate that this brings."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,I feel bad for them having to stand :P
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Please bring back the old format with Dan or Hal as judge. Don't let Andy's absence ruin Movie Fights.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,I like everything about the show but changing the ringing of the bell triggered me
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Great comeback for Movie Fights!
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,I feel like you nailed it.  All the important parts of the old show without the bad.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Pleeease don't show the fights in the sidebar!

u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I liked everything new but it’s going to take some getting used too with the 3 to 2 fighters. I understand that some questions don’t help fights like you have to answer with yes,no, maybe."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I'm torn on the two people standing change, but everything else I love. Hal as host and 3 judges were two things I'd asked for a lot.

Maybe they should make divisions like with Collider's schmoedown. A more competitive 1 on 1 division and a looser free for all one."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"and holy crap, I can gt behind both sides of the argument
I mean, I truly agree with both and disagree with both simultaneously"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"ok... how can someone even consider wonder woman a great movie ? I am generaly asking, it was boring, bland and the only saving grace was the relationship between trevor and diana
Every single Marvel movie this year was much better"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"It's been said in other comments but I just wanted to add in that Hal is amazing, so glad he's hosting now ... really Hal should just host everything on this channel he's the best."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,I would watch the predator-pirates film. Sounds awesome
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Honestly, I love the format, it just feels a little awkward without sound effects for the slides. Love Hal as host!"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Matt Reeves should direct Star Wars Episode 9. He proves he can finish off an emotionally satisfying Sci-fi trilogy i.e. Planet of the Apes prequels.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Hal was always my favorite judge! I'm extremely glad to see movie fights back. I prefer when you guys sit because everyone seems more comfortable and it's a bit more welcoming. As far as 2 fighters as opposed to 3..it worked this time. And it works when both fighters are great/strong in their own ways. But if you happen to have a fighter who turns out to be a dud or a somewhat of a bore, 2 fighters will be a lot harder to watch. Just friendly suggestions 😊 this was def a great show back!"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I am glad to have you guys back, I really missed it. That said:

-I hate only 2 contestants, I preferred having the larger cast
-I really hate having fewer rounds and shorter shows. As in I despise it. 

Bring back the full shows!!"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Love it. More focused and while there's passion in the arguements it's nice to hear the crew laugh and everyone jokes around between rounds, really tempers the tension."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,I like the old format better but I liked Hal as the judge. Maybe save this format for when the belt is on the line.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Spencer should've won round one and I REALLLYY wanna see his Zootopia 2
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Logan was the best ;)
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Really liked Hal as host though I do prefer 3 fighters to 2.The return of Dan the people's champion
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,let the fighters sit
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Thanks so much for revamping and bringing back movie fights.

I think you should have triple threats and big fatal four way fights in the future too though. I love the new format but I liked seeing the opinion of more than two fighters, it was great to have three differing opinions and seeing the arguments against them.

Bring in old favourites and new fighters in 2018 to start from scratch with the old records being rebooted... fighters like Harloff, Ellis, Napzok, Mike Carlson, Scott Mantz, Roger Barr, Alicia Malone, JTE, Marc Andreyko, Max Landis, Jason Inman, Chris Stuckman, John Campea, Jon Schnepp, Mark Reilly, Josh Macuga etc.

Theirs so much fun to be had with this new format and interesting fights to be made... Harloff vs Ellis, JTE vs Macuga, Reilly vs Campea, Carlson vs Napzok, Mantz vs Landis would all be great fights."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I thought dan was talking about there being 3 good marvel comedies this year, which I figured were Spider-Man: homecoming, guardians of the galaxy 2, and Thor ragnorak, but then he just mentioned some random comedies"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Liked for the montage.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I First want to say that this format felt very strange to me and I want you to know that I think everyone would be a lot more excited to watch Movie fights if you went back to the old Movie Fights format. However... I love the idea of multiple judges and Hall was great as the host!!! Also - Screen Junkies - I know it was hard coming up with all of these changes, so thank you for the effort and, even if nothing changes with this new style, I will ALWAYS come back to watch  Movie Fights!!!"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,I dont mind the two fighters but it feels to formal - the thing i loved about movie fights was that it was a couple of friends (sometimes over a few drinks) sitting and talking about movies. Give the fighters a chair and bring back the nice big table :)
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,I'm fine with the changes. Just bring back the third fighter and we're good.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,i really like the new format. i hated the shout matches that the 3person format would usually devolve into. plus love roth and danielle!

u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Hal is such a great judge: he actually challenges the fighters to think more deeply about the question at hand.

u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"About the new format

Love:
• New modes (sabotage, etc.)
• 3 hosts (especially Hal)
• New graphics (scoreboard, round list on the side, etc.)

Hate:
• 2-People fight
• Fighter standing up
• Audience being third judge"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I do slightly miss the 3 fighters format, although I think that Hal makes a great host - also I miss the desk, the standing up just feels a bit formal and slightly awkward; but it's great to have you guys back"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Glad to see Movie Fights back! I believe podiums should be saved for championship belt fights. There should be 3-4 fighters. I do enjoy Hal as a judge. I wouldn't mind Alicia coming back as a judge. Roth, you need to be a fighter because you're awesome at it! Get off the sofa! Audience votes can turn into a popularity contest. I think it should be used only for tie breaking purposes."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Spider-Man Homecoming is the best Superhero Movie of 2017.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Just here to say Thor Ragnarok wasn't that good. That is all.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Thor Ragnorak is the better superhero movie
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I am really excited to get Movie Fights back, but what is with this less aggressive nonsense Dan is talking about? Who is asking for less aggression? The best parts of Movie Fights are when the fighters are passionate about their arguments. The show is called Movie Fights, not Polite Movie Debates. Sure, there are areas for improvement, but the fighters actually fighting is not one of them."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Dan may have a DAN RANT graphics assigned to him but, man, Spencer fights like a Gladiator. All attack mode."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Don't make them stand up for more than 1 hour.#brutal
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Dan for the win!
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"If you want a Big Lebowski set in the Star Wars universe, just watch The Men Who Stare at Goats...."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Its a welcome back! Loved the airplane references, and it felt like the guys really cared about winning which is always nice to see"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I also prefer 3 for the ""normal"" movie fights and 2 challengers for ""special editions"". 3 just make it more competitive and fun, because people have to concentrate on more than one argument.

And I preferred the ""sit-down"" table also.

Apart from this: well done. Technically a bit rough around the edges, but cool cool cool.
I hope the drunk movie fights come back, too."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I always love your videos and episodes but i totally miss the other format :( this one looks too dark, the volume was a little low and having the guys standing is a little stressing. Other than that, it was great!"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Seems like the show is a bit more written in advance now... 

Definitely more sterile and less down to earth as the old set/setting. 

Oh well, no choice but to move on I guess...."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"everything seems great, I wish dan was the host though."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Keep the good job going you guys. Hal made a great host really enjoyed him hosting. My only ciriticism is i think 3 fighters was much more enjoyable gave more diversed opinions and fired up the fight. But maybe the two fighter think is temporary?
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Consensus judging is fine, but like most everyone else here I very much prefer 3 fighters. Also, I really don't think it was as negative as maybe you guys feel it was. At least it didn't come off that way. I also hope that doesn't mean Marc Andreyko can't come back lol!!"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Listened to he podcast and the arguments  were SOLID. Just came to this video and I gotta say the format is weird. Really liked the chill sitting around a desk format, but so glad to have this show back and it looks like you’re not messing around with topics and arguments."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Every time Hal hosted in the old movie fights, I thought he did an amazing job. I loved that he would make the fighters think on their toes a bit with his added questions. So I'm really glad he's the bhost now. The only downside about him as a judge though, is that I won't get to hear his signature ""I came here to kick ass and chew bubble gum and I'm all out of bubble gum"" line."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Please back to three fighters and sitting, I get the need to revamp but this is a different show.."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Do a honest trailer for Thor Ragnarok
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Before I even read the comments I know it's full of I DON'T LIKE CHANGE FIRST STAR WARS NOW MOVIE FIGHTS 😭😭
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,I agree with everyone’s comments but I guess Movie Fights is just testing the waters and delivering something that we really love (movie fights) with the cards that they have. I believe and hope that they’ll slowly bring back the gang. We support you SJ!
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I think you still need that bell sound between rounds, the transitions between them felt like they were missing something"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Liked the new visuals. Loved the 3 judges. seams like it would eliminate bias patterns  but it did feel a bit empty with only 2 fighters
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Hal, you're a great judge.  I look forward to seeing a lot more women on this show in the future.  You may want to get some sound booth foam in there, though.  You've got quite an echo."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Go back to the old way
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Wtf?   I was wondering what happened to movie fights....now your back. Its like when my aunt got a facelift and we all had to act like her new face was fine.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,I miss the old layout. Where's the bell and hammer? Why are there only two fighters on? Why are there no chairs? What happened to the old Studios?
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,*Can we just acknowledge that Dan is the best fighter and make him the judge already?! :D*
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Nice, but Hal is not my judge."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,I love how u guys came back and it's just my opinion but I like 3+ fighters
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Having public input as an official vote is a bad idea. It's too easy to vote without listening to the arguments or just vote on prior preference.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Great to have you all back!! 

Just some criticism, I think sitting will feel more comfortable, a bit difficult with the new set up. And the microphones seem distance.  Not as clear as they used to be.  Everything else was great!!"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"plz just bring 3 fighters into it thats all it needs and chairs, or mabye sometimes do the 3 fighters i do love hal and dont hate the 2 fighter format"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Too official. If that makes sense. Something about the cameras and the standing and the two people, i don’t know."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Wow y'all sucked all the fun out of movie fights. It's a shorter show and it feels twice as long.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Why did you guys break Movie Fights?
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Spencer lost the fight off the bat when he said he lost the coin flip. What a stupid move because everyone now knows his arguments are full of bull.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,So glad to have Movie Fights back.  Hal was great as always.  Love Dan the man.  Please give us more and more please.  I like this better than the old show.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Yay, it’s back! Are you going to keep releasing audio only podcast versions?"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Everything's good just need 3 fighters. With 3 people it actually feels like a Movie Fight. With 2 it feels like Movie Debates.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,At Last....
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Well, clearly, according to the thumbnail, it's one that has beards."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Logan is great, I enjoyed Logan, but it is not re-watchable in any way like Ragnarok.  Not saying it shouldn't have won based on that, but Ragnarok wins that sub-point."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Kudos to Spencer, he defiled the all time winner with his Thor stand. I still think Logan is better, but he truly solidified his point - ""can you tell their names?"" buuuurn.

Now I agree with preferring the 3 fighters and the  less formal style, but I do prefer the 3 judges.  Great that they're back."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Wow. Movie Fights has completely lost all charm and spontaneous wit. Very disappointing. Standing up doesn't help either.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Everything just seems forced now
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,I just dislike this format. The other format was more enjoyable
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,sounds a bit echo-ey almost like a lot of hals voice echo is being picked up through dan and spencers more then his own mic cant wait to see how it goes though
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,It's back!!!!!!!!
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Justice League was the best for me. I really don't get why it gets so much hate. Logan is close second. Wonder Woman, Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol.2 & Thor - Ragnarök were ok. Spiderman Homecoming was pretty dissapointing"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,I like the new format!
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"No, just no.  If talent competitions have taught me anything the public doesn't know jack about voting, hell if voting has told me anything the public doesn't know how to vote.

Sanjaya stayed in AI longer than he should of because of this, Signature end up losing to a mediocre dancing kid in BGT, and who can forget Patrick losing to ZZ on Tough Enough.  Don't get me started on elections, where some of the smaller candidates should have easily took president because they aren't insane.

It starts boiling down to a popularity contest rather than who has the better views on a subject, or actual talent.  So for gods sake, keep the public on as an after opinion like before, but don't make them part of the voting process."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Love this format over the old one.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Great comedy does not have diminishing returns Dan. That's why classic comedys like Seinfeld are still funny.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"More negativity!! In all honesty, as many others have said, I would rather have the 3 fighters. Otherwise everything else was fine."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,The third fight was perhaps my favorite fight of all time!
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,I am happy you brought this back. The new style seems a little uncomfortable but I will get use to this. Keep pushin fellas/ladies.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Yasssss
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,HahahahaThor Ragnarok??hahahhaahahahahaa THOR RAGNAROK?????hhahahaha you guys are hilarious
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Two fighters makes sense for a debate show and it worked, worked real good.  It could be that the set is darker, but I think having 3 fighters adds a warmth to the show.  You know like the banter and the side conversations in the background.  The previous iteration felt like you were hanging out with them, that this doesn't have.  On a side note, Hal was surprisingly good."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Don't like the podiums, also miss 3 fighters. Lastly, the viewers should not get a vote, they don't usually base their votes on the actual debate, they just pick their favorite movie. But glad to have you guys fighting again. Can't wait to see where you go from here."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"bring back the old concept 
3 fighters and plz sit down thank U"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Logan was brilliant. Badass, sad, all round amazing"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Just finished watching. I liked the new format. Standing fighters looks and feels better imo. Two fighters are also better than three imo, because with three fighters there were hard to sometimes hear properly. So yea, overall great changes. Just make sure to get good fighters every time. Glad to see movie fights again. Thumbs up."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Glad the show is back! Love the new format! All the best
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Logan wasn't as good as some people think.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,The net neutrality lies get old.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I have nothing against Dan as a person but we would never, ever get along wrt movies.  Even if we agree on a film we would agree for completely different reasons.  That being said, this new format is...different.  I might or might not watch this new iteration; it would probably depend on the fighters and the topics."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Dan won the first round easy.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Hal is who should have been hosting movie fights the entire time. Marvelous. Most people are already saying this, but the three person format did add a level of uniqueness to your debates that was pleasant (though there are obvious benefits to the two person format, such as: better organization, it being easier to keep track of everyone's comments and giving everyone a turn to speak and respond to each other). Over all great work and I am excited to see movie fights back. Thank you for providing another great show."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"This is great, glad to see ya'll back, still hoping one day to get tag teamed into one of these :)"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"i think is better to have the full screen version. Is nicer to what on bigger screen and I don't like to have the questions spoiled. Other than that great format, I can't wait to have the show back weekly."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Miss the 3 person fight.  I like the look of the show looks like a sporty version but would change back to a table sitting down instead of the political stands.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Been a movie fights fan since the first episode and not gonna lie i already miss the old format :( It's cool to see some change, but it needs 5 rounds and 3 fighters, there was nothing wrong with that. But i do love the 3 judges, 1 never worked. Bring back the table!"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Add a 3rd podium for another fighter, get some tall comfortable chairs, then this format would be perfect. Still enjoyed it though!"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,not sure I'm a huge fan of the graphics. They're like a little too new-esk. That combined with the weird standing and podium makes it feel a little too formal guess
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,JTE FTW! Everyone did right by his wife and him. Also bring back three fighters.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"As much as I loved this fight, (good job guys), I really think 3 person fight is better because we get to see wild card choices and different perspectives.Two seems too safe and boring."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Does this mean that movie fights are back????
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Great show. I dislike the fan vote point. You guys have been vocal about how a majority of the twitter votes are people who aren't watching or popularity contests...

I would say to just go to a 3 judge format. Weigh in on the comments from social media, give names kudos to funny or interesting fan comments. But forget those polls"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Love movie fights and happy they are back like the new rules and voting but have to say hate the new set feels like a game show from the 70’s think about bringing back a table making it more layer back and have room for more then just 2 fighters just my opinion and I And sure I will watch them no matter your choices but feels to game showiest Again glad your back at just an opinion
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Just a small nitpick but Logan isn't a superhero film. Just because it is based on a comic book doesn't make it a superhero film.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,I miss the old logo xD
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"That montage was total crap. Need the ""Let them fight"" from Godzilla."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Please keep it at 3 fighters so the 1v1's can be more personal in the future like when Dan fought Landis
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,I;m having high school debate flashbacks.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"even though there seems to be so much negativity that has always surrounded Movie Fights i think this new version of the show is a really good step in the right direction. i love the idea of multiple judges, and even though having us the fans vote will probably cause some issues it, allows fans to have a voice and feel like they are a part of it which is a really awesome idea."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,I love seeing you guys back!!! But I’d say please bring back 3 fighters other than that welcome back ☺️ also Hal You’re awesome as a host
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,OMG voice painful 😖
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Showdown of the Australian beefy men.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,I like the 3 fighters tho
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I'll watch because I want to support you folks, but not a fan of the format. Maybe you'll change my mind :)"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Lol I guess knocking dead isn't coming back eh?
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"ScreenJunkies, I’m excited to see you back in action! Hal as host is a babe: mid-round questions is lovely. Enjoying the change of background and I’m liking the idea of the new set up for games, and vote by audience but I feel like the audience could just go for whoever entertained them or if they just vote based on their opinion. For example, if you ever had Max Landis back and people didn’t like his argument style, they’d vote the opposite just because. 
I also prefer the contrast of the 3 Fighters just because I like more varied takes on the same topic, and I agree with some of the other commenters that by having everyone standing, it’s lost it’s “we’re just mates that love movies sat around talking about movies” aspect, which is how we fans truly can connect with the show. It looks a lot more professional now, and that could be a great thing for you, but I just think the nerd memorabilia, a couple of chairs, and a coffee mug even on the cool new podiums would just help get that little bit of community back. 

I know you’re ever going to see this and a one in a 1000 comment is never really that relevant, but comments are just that. Still enjoying seeing everyone back to what they love again though, and excited to follow the journey for another couple of years like I have before

EDIT: wanna just add on the side that I hope that ScreenJunkies don’t feel like we are unsupportive. Some fans will find it hard to adjust, but the mass majority just want to help rebuild the show that we loved, and they loved to make, but no go back to the past. I hope the little knick nacks, memorabilia, and decorations being gone now will be good if you start to bring it back slowly because it’ll be like ScreenJunkies rebuilding their identity with us all over again."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Really glad that u brought movie fights back, and i understand that u want to have a different approach to separate it from the previous iterations, but i cant get myself into this new one (and believe me i tried!).  Hope u can bring the 3 fighters format back.  Wish u the best nevertheless! Hal you rock"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Honey I shrunk the... X it's always sunny          Honey I shrunk the gang
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"1. Please sit down when doing the movie fight. Watching them stand the whole time was very weird and seem unnatural. 

2. I would rather have 3 fighters.

The rest was good"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,I would wtch the predator movie.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Love the new format
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"#1: Let the fighters sit down.
#2: Bring back the sound transitions (the bell ringing, the aplause when someone gets a point, etc)
#3: Bring back three fighters
#4: Just one judge works better for me."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Get hall out of host chair, and bring back three fighters"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Logan was depressing. I don't need more depressing stuff in my life
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Hate change... but surprisingly got used to new format quicker than I thought I would. Love seeing Dan and Spencer fight under any circumstances
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"That comment on Peter Vankman being flirty with young employees... too soon, Spencer"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Venkman thinks everything is mumbo-jumbo; he wouldn't be able to free him mind enough to control, let alone master the Force. He's not gonna make a great Jedi. Actually, he's probably more like Han Solo. 

I haven't seen ""Airplane"" in a while, so I cannot say anything good or bad for Ted."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"This format just feels much more sterile and is lacking the enjoyable relaxed and fun feel the old one had, however loving Hal as the judge"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,I clicked like just for that montage
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"RIP flickbait. I know lots of changes happened and flickbait is pretty much screen junkies news, and flickbait barely gets any views... but I still want it..."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Need to do an all speedround Movie Fight sometime.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I love the new format, seeing them standing for an hour is making me uncomfortable in their stead though"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Others have said this, but Ill add my voice since you may adjust later : 
-Hal as host : cool, wouldnt mind some variety though (Alicia and Dan did it best of the ""guest""-judges in the past imo)
-fighters standing : meh, sitting seemed less like a gameshow. This felt a bit awkward.
-2 fighters : not bad as such, fairer from the game point of view, but 3 makes for more random nonsense, which is more fun to watch.
-votes : MUCH better to do it this way. Not convinced on audience vote, they tend to go for the more popular answer / fighter rather than the better arguments, but why not I guess..."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I think I agree with what many others have said, I really preferred the show when there were 3 fighters. I definitely get trying to make it feel fresh and new. That urge to make it different enough to not remind you of the older version, but the older version was a smash hit for a reason. I honestly don't even watch many movies but I watched Movie Fights every week because it was entertaining to see people passionately (and sometimes chaotically) debate movies they felt strongly for. It worked. It doesn't need to change this much."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Loved Hal's presence and follow up questions, definitely keep that aspect! But agreed with the others, I would probably prefer the 3 fighter format and the original table so they are closer and it's less formal"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Not a fan of the new direction
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I dig the background and design, but miss 3 fighters and host at a table. Seemed more relaxed and less uncomfortable."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"So, I know you guys had to do this honest trailer because The Last Jedi came out, but seriously, DO AN HONEST TRAILER FOR THE RAID: REDEMPTION! You guys have never done any action movie related to kung fu like The Raid, Ip Man, Kung Fu Panda, or ANY of the Bruce Lee movies! Seriously, you guys need to do a kung fu movie, and I'm recommending The Raid because you guys have mentioned it before, and The Raid is one of the best movies ever!!! Quit dragging your butts and do an Honest Trailer for The Raid: Redemption!!!"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Glad Movie Fights is back, a different change to the show, not fully watched it yet so lets see how it goes..."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Dan, taking offense at Spencer's comment on chris hemsworth's comedic chops is neither here nor there honestly lol."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Not loving this new format...
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,No belt was harmed in the production of this Movie Fights. XD
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Good job everyone! It was good to hear opinions and not be shouted over. I think the more you do the new format the more relaxed it'll be :) I love movie fights so it's good to be back.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I like the new format. Especially only having 2 fighters. Movie Fights was running way too long before. I like Hal’s hosting/judging. Asking them specific questions within the Fights was well done and made it more interesting as well as steering the fight a little bit. Dan and Spencer were really bringing it! Good job on the new, improved (and quieter) Movie Fights!"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Sit down, 3 fighter format IMO is much better, having the host have the most power in judging as well works best....please bring back the old set or a revamped version of the old set, sit down is much informal, this new podium stage looks cheesy..."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,liked how civil this was but i do like 3 fighters
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,liked how civil this was but i do like 3 fighters
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Personally, I loved this new style! Thank you for bringing back this show, Screen Junkies! 

Hal makes a fantastic host and judge; he provides levity where it is needed, yet also probes the fighters with well-intentioned questions that keep the fighters on their toes and forces them to prepare defenses and arguments in many ways."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Like the Schmoedown feel but feels a little too much like a game show as opposed too an informal and fun podcast game. I preferred the grass roots feel from before. I will still watch every week religiously so I guess it matters not
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Do it honest trailer, please!!"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I think Nolan is sometimes emotional-like interstellar and memento, which I prefer to his much less humanist films like the batman trilogy"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"The new  modern- and simpler-looking set and graphics are awesome! The system with host and judges is great as well. It was the face-off between Dan and Spencer but three fighters are more fun because the third could change it completely. The rules concerning the amount of rounds were also better beforehand. Overall, it now feels more like a serious formal fight and less like a fight with the charater of a discussion about movies between friends; maybe because there are no chairs and the light is darker. Very glad that Movie Fights is back but please hear the community's concerns."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"The movies I watch over and over are all comedies, and yes I know the jokes off by heart but that's why I love it."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,love the new setup!
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Please give these guys a chair
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,I'm glad to see movie fights back and I actually like the new format! The one thing that i would change is the banners. They are way to big and make it look more like a Pokemon lets-play (sorry JTE)
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I like the format, however, the set is a lot less inviting - and let those poor guys sit down, give them a chair!"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Using the fact that Spencer prefers Logan to Thor against him is absurdly stupid. This is supposed to be Movie Fights isn't it? Where you argue opinions that don't necessarily represent your own.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Never comment but have to agree. I’d also love to see third fighter
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Seems way too overproduced now. Nice sets and everything, but I prefer the more laid back round table feeling of the old fights. Standing for so long can't be great, and how are you guys going to do Drunk Movie Fights on your feet.

And of course, 3 fighters. I want the chaos.

The other changes are nice though."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I like hal as host, but his ""follow up"" questions were infuriating cuz they were really tangential to the main question and seemed childish and random"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Bored watching this and I have enjoyed watching pretty much all of the previous movie fights.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"hal was always my favorite host, but three fighters is a better format"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"not really fond of the new format - it looks more like jeopardy or a political debate.... BRING BACK THREE CONTESTANTS, PLEEEAAASE"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Great, you are back.  Love to see you guys again.  Lot of love from Germany"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Welcome back movie fights 👍🏾
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Can you do an honest trailer of The Shining? (Thumbs up if you agree so they can see)
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I am very happy you kept movie fights, The format kinda worked for Dan and Spence but I can see this show dragging with less interesting people when there is no third person to throw a spanner in the cogs"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,This video is crazy boring.... Can I have the five minutes of my life back?
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Do an honest trailer of Mall Cop!!!!
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"in future if both fighters pick the same movie, instead of flipping a coin, that movie should be off the table."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Predator 2 was way better then Predator.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Brennan huff would clearly be the best Jedi
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"This is nice and all, but where's Flickbait at"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"OMG!!! So glad to see you guys are back, love this new format :D"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Just to add my own two cents: bring back the third fighter! And also give them stools or something to sit on. Feels too stiff when they're standing.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"go back to the old format,, its not working . at least sit on stool bars and make them 3-4 players"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I love the idea of multiple judges, I've wanted that for a long time, I can't say I like the fan voting though. I also miss having 3 fighters and the old question format. Oh, and Hal did a nice job as host too!"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Bring back 3 fighters plz :) other than that, like the new format. Also, more questions."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,It's happening!!!
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I'm going to go completely against the tide and say that the 1v1 format gives more energetic and passionate moments versus one person watching the two other people fight. Plus, I also enjoy the new look e.g. podiums and yes, even the standing. The standing makes them much more energetic and the sitting just makes it seem tired. So I like the evolution."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"The graphics are a little clunky, not a fan of the side and bottom bar during the fight. Though, do love the one on one fights. A lot more concise and open for equal debate. Less of a free for all. Thumbs up."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Say “Now I’m mad.  Your supposed to say why!”
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Do Thor: Ragnarok pls
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,I like this !

u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,I also think it should be 3 fighters
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"2 fighters ruins it, there have to be 3 so they can conspire to destroy each other :)"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Here's a thought... Instead of the 3 fighters you used to have or the 2 you have now...
Why not 4? Like, tournament style. 2 vs. 2 (best of 5 each), then the top 1 vs 1 (best of 3)? Just a thought.
Gotta say though, I like your new judging style. Facts + Fans and Moderator breaks the tie is a lot more fair than... The other way it was done."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,I'm going Kevin hart

2. Logan
3. Wonder Woman 
4. Thor Ragnarok 
5. Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 (Did anyone else completely forget this came out this year)
6. Justice League"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,I don't really like the way Roth makes her choices. I think Hal should retain veto power. Hope to see more of a tournament style to movie fights next year.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,I like this format a bit better. It was fun with three fighters but a one on one version makes it feel more intense. I'd watch another one.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"The cut from three to two fighters, as well as first to four points, has improved on both the time of the program (down to an hour!) and increased the amount of depth a fight can have. It would be nice to have three, but I certainly see all the good two gives us. Not to mention it will allow for easier scheduling."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,I wish they would sit down. It seems awkward and stressful standing. Also needs more fighters.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Hey! Do a honest trailer of hachiko pls!
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I really enjoyed this new format! Having Hal as the Judge was inspired, his follow up questions were spot on and he kept the flow of the game going well...The new points system worked well with it being a democratic vote. The old way was good at the time but this is an evolution of a great format. Keep it up Screen Junkies 👌"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Hate the new setting for the show... We need 3 fighters back, 2 just makes it boring. I hate that they include the audience in the voting, it will just be a popularity contest. Making them stand makes me feel uncomfortable, let them sit and enjoy themselves. We will enjoy it more. And that opening, ugh! The last one was so much better!!!"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,BRING BACK STEVE
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Positive overall! However, I do miss having a third fighter and I could do without the ever present text at the side of the screen. I always enjoyed being surprised by a fresh question."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,I understand the drastic change. I think it's mostly for the staff not to be constantly reminded of you know who. But I would prefer a more casual fight. If you can keep it different but comfortable that would be ideal
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"This is the perfect thing to do with movie fights. Just what I was hoping for. Well done, guys."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Glad you're back, guys, but the poll is gonna end being more a popularity contest than anything else."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Maybe have 2 judges and the audience be the tie breaker? That way they don't have too much power but they're still involved
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"So glad Movie Fights is back, it's one of my favorite things about Screen Junkies."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,I actually prefer this new set up as opposed to the old with three people. This one has kept me more on my toes and makes it very exciting! I prefer a debate instead of a group of friends talking about movies. It’s more exciting to me:)
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Really? While Google is available? Was that in doubt 2 years ago before the government ""saved us all and made the internet free?"""
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Not sure about the standing but I don’t mind the rest. 3 judges is definitely an upgrade
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,the set decoration will haunt me in my dreams tonight.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,please invite kevin smith and mark bernardin for a fight against each other. it'll be awsome!

u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,I miss the more formal setting.  This game show setting isnt doing it for me. The other changes are kinda cool.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Bring back old format please with Hal still hosting the show. please.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Super glad this is back!! Loved it. I really wanna see Pirates v Predators too
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Missed having three fighters but love that with more time there were more questions like light saber skills and monologue for ur character. Better content that challenges the fighters to really know there stuff! Very enjoyable! Can't wait til next year!
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,I like this new format. The 1v1 keeps everything more on topic imo but maybe do 5 questions. Otherwise great video so glad this show is back.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"3 fighters, let'em sit"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,I enjoyed this. One note: standing makes it feel more tense rather than fun.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Yess hal is awsome
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Why can't we just have the old movie fights minus the creep...? :( ... If they are standing up, does that mean that there will be no more drunk movie fights!? Or stoned movie fights? Oh man..... Change makes me nervous and sad..."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I wouldn't mind this format going forward, but I do hope there will be some ""special editions"" as well, either special guests, more fighters etc like before."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,8 minutes into the show and already can't believe how much I've missed this!
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"My favourite was Thor Ragnarok. I fell sleep in the movie theater when watching Logan. Thor Ragnarok made me excited and wanted to watch it immediately again!. Not saying Logan was bad, I loved it but my favourite is Thor"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Hal Rudnik is the one whoum got me interested in ScreenJunkies. Nice to see him host Movue Fights.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"The old format was appealing because it really looked like just a group of friends chilling and talking movies together. This format feels like a very formal and generic game show. 

Nonetheless, it’s our favorite people in a different set. We might just need to get used to it."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Thor Ragnarok was fun, but it was forgettable."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,3 fighters and please sit down.... i feel uncomfortable for these guys standing for 1 hour...
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,I do not like the audience having a fight because a lot of people will just go with the movie they like more and not go with the actual better argument.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"My notes would center around a lack of energy in this version of the show compared to the original. Maybe a bit of trepidation as you’re feeling out the new format? 

I definitely appreciate the huge reduction in fighters talking over each other. I think the point/counterpoint style does a lot for the quality of the debate and the respect between fighters. 

I wouldn’t have thought it would make a difference, but the canned applause after a winner is announced might help with the energy? Or a faster pace from the host? I would also love to see the third fighter return. The three person dynamic was a highlight."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"A problem: the fact checker can't be a judge, if they are ever going to complete for the belt.  It would be too easy to charge them with unfairness if they neg a competitor they might face in a later fight."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Love the new set and the new Graphics..!!! Glad to see movie fights back..!!
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Love the new Movie Fights format. Good job guys!!
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Glad to have you guys back! I’m still on round 1 but I’m loving it so far
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"My superhero movie list:

6)Justice League"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Obviously there's going to be some growing pains here. I'm not sure how I like the new format, but it's like with any other change, I'm sure I'll get used to it. There is one thing that I think doesn't work -- the fan vote. I understand the thought behind it, but I honestly think that takes something away from the show. People are biased and I think the judges in this need to have some proven level of expertise and be nonbiased. Not sure how I feel about the two contestant thing either, but I know that's more of a personal reaction to change rather than a this doesn't work for the show.. Anyways, glad to have movie fights back."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Glad you guys did not stop this bc he wins if you did and pervert do not deserve to win
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,thor was fun like most marvel movies but I didn't really feel nothing other then a fun time at the movie although thor is more rewatchable so there is that but as a movie Logan>>Thor the weak reaction to thor's friends dying is indicative of some of my issues with marvel movies the tone and insistence on making almost everything in to a joke....for me thor is tied with wonder woman for 2nd.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"A few questions for you all; you've already done Best Movie Fight, but I wanna see more specifics.
Best Hand-to-Hand Duel, Best Weapon Duel, Best Outnumbered Fight (1 or few vs. many), Best Army Battle, Best Navy Battle, Best Aerial Battle, Best Space Battle, Best Martial Arts Battle, Best Magic Duel/Battle, and Best Superpowered Duel/Battle."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"You need more sounds effects throughout the battle.... buzzers, bell ringing, an actual crowd applause for the winner, just to help the overall enviroment which would help it sound like you're not in a studio. I agree with people saying that there should be three people, it just makes it more fun to watch and everyone should sit down.

I enjoy seeing the score and future arguments on the side bar and three judges is great as well, less room for bias. I am disagreeing with most in the chat about giving the public a vote. however maybe give the host and fact checker their vote first and in case of a tie... go to the poll.

Maybe make the background theme a more cinema-esque theme as well.

Great job guys, glad you're back!"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I am so glad Movie Fights is back. I love the adding of 3 judges.


My gripes: I think 3 fighters was better.

Bring back chairs and a table, them standing was just making me feel anxious and doesn't feel like they were comfortable. This new ""debate format"" looks like they are arguing about politics, not movies with their friends/colleagues. The round table, comfy seats for an hour and half, was never a problem. This is way too formal for the theme of ""Movie Fights"". 

Turn on the lights and add some warm-ness to the set. Please. Make the room more nerdy, more light-hearted.. Add knick knacks and movie posters and life back into the room. 
I get wanting to start fresh, but you guys kind of stripped away all of the love and fun in the room. I feel like they're hanging out in a cold cellar and not a nerd den. 

Work on the overlay/UI. It's so bulky and distracts from the fighters. Don't bother with the side bar, or put that information all at the bottom third of the screen. You don't even need to list the questions in the side bar, just put that in the Youtube Description box with timecodes. Just have the question and the score at the bottom third. Make the boxes surrounding them smaller too. The ratio of text to outlined box isn't right."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,can you guys do The Inhumans Tv show
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"So great to see that the best show on the web is back!
A few comments though:
- you did indeed get my thumbs up with the montage! :-)
- two fighters instead of three makes the arguments a little more stale but it can still be great I think if you take advantage of the new format
- public vote is totally irrelevant for these fights if you ask me
- do not hesitate to turn up the spontaneity and the craziness, that's what makes you so great!"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Good job Hal. Prefer 3 fighters.

u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Hope there being two fighters was just because it was Spencer vs Dan and they go back to three.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Getting used to the new set was an adjustment but Movie Fights was definitely due for a revamp. And one round in.. I'm really liking it. Great to see Dan and Spencer back up there fighting and adding Danielle and the social media role is A+
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Welcome back, guys. We missed you 😊"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Please 3 fighters. And Spencer is NOT my champion. Dan is the real movie fights champ.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Look.....I'll take it....missed the show......host is replaceable
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Imo Ragnarok is a less dramatic version of guardians
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"make an honest trailer for The Silence Of The Lambs, please. please... please... please... please... please... please... please"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Should of gone spiderman 3 for james franco
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I'm not a fan of the new format at all. Much prefer the old. I don't know who has been giving feedback for this to happen but I don't think they were right. Also I like Hal for his side shows which really suit his hosting stile, but not a fan of him hosting movie fights or being the tiebreaker judge. I thought Dan would have taken over from ""he who will not be named"". I think Joe or even the guy who is on SJU with the breaking news (sorry I forgot your name) would be better choices"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,LOGAN LOGAN LOGAN
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"three fighters with a judge (alicia or hal i guess). this is rough. and really don't care for roth on movie fights. this doesn't work. no biggie, just change it up and good luck on the next iteration!"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Please let these guys sit down. Please. They looked exhausted 10 minutes in.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Is there something off with the sound? At least for the people on the couch. And I think I can hear Hal better than anyone else. I love the fact that you're back, but don't you get tired for standing? :D Hal is a great judge. I don't love seeing the info banners the whole time."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,I like this format but maybe you could do some special fights with 3 fighters or last fighter standing
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Switching to 1 on 1 is okay hopefully it will avoid some of the overtalking of the old format. Not sure about having to stand for a full hour... might limit contestants... i mean if magic happened and yo uhhh some how got someone like stan lee to come debait super hero movies would make him stand and hour... dont kill stan is all im saying.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"It's great but i miss the more friendly chill and fun debates,this is a bit to formal"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"i love that you guys are back at it! really enjoyed this one! love Hal as a host, love the new set, the new overlays and intro are great! 
im not quite sure if i enjoy the 1 v 1 as much as a 3 people free for all though. it feels more like a debate and less like friends discussing some movie topics. its definetly entertaining, but in a different way. I'm looking forward to the next one! 
some small things: 
- the audio is a bit far away at times. if you want to have everyone standing up, thats cool, but they either have to bow down into the mic, basically eat it, at all times, or you should look into using a LAV mic, so they can move freely without loosing audio quality when leaning back. 
- i dont know if the audience vote is a good idea. as we saw in the past, the biggest and or latest released movie will basically always win that vote, regardless of the argument. i think it would be better to have that audience vote as a tie breaker. 
all in all, i love that you guys are working on it and trying to improve the show! thanks for sticking with it guys :)"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Very disappointed that the belt wasn't up for grabs. Dan is still the real champion, as shown by this video. The arguments were great, overall glad the show is back."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Can we just have the old format with Hal as a judge!!!
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Good episode
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Thanks for coming back. Movie fights has been my favorite SJ series, and i'm looking forward to the new era.

With the 1 on 1 format, I'd really love to see Jeff Sneider take on JTE"

u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Liked the ""3 Judges"" idea, but couldn't get past how the new design and presentation makes everything feel like a cheesy Game Show Network original.  It just didn't feel as relaxed and casual as older format, which was one of the main reasons i enjoyed it."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Super excited to see this series back, and really enjoy most of the updates to the format of the show!  After seeing this episode, I miss the 3 fighter setup, but it's not the worst thing in the world.  HDR Uploads soon??? :D"

u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Glad to have you back guys! Miss the 3 fighters sitting around though
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"How about 3 votes each round? Hal, the internet and a new guest each time. Would make it less of a popularity contest"

u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Fun new format, thank you for bringing back movie fights! I only have one suggestion. Hal is a great host, but I think he needs a bigger role in voting. He should have the final say on who gets the point, while taking input from everyone else, with the fan vote not being revealed until after. Without one person having the final vote, it feels like the judging has less personality as everyone is more likely to agree or be swayed in a certain direction."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,I love the new format!
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Like the new format and more focused style. Keep it up!
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,I like the new format but please take away the public vote! Those votes will not be thought out!
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Great comeback episode!
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Is 'Movie Fights' still gonna be tough?
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Such a joy to see you guys back at it. Hal's a great host/judge. I could see Lon judging as well though. Production looks good as well, although I'd probably warm up the lighting a bit and acoustically treat the room some more (there's a bit of harsh echo going on, but nothing critical, could probably be fixed with some absorbing panels hidden away here and there). Overall: Great job and I'm excited for 2018's matches."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Hal is great, the format is a bit too formal."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Hal is a great fighter but an even better host. Make some noise.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Glad Hal has a role in this! More Hal and I'm happy!
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,This one will lose its core fans. To formally. Big pass!
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,I like Logan more but Spencer's argument was better and I think people are just too emotionally invested in Logan so thats why Dan won.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I enjoyed it but can't help but hope there will be more than 2 fighters in future fights. Often some of the questions lended themselves to more than just two answers, and sometimes having a choice scrutinized by two points of view is more interesting"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,For the backwards fight I choose Lone Star from Spaceballs don't get much better than that I would have won easily

u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,The set looks a little like a Skynet Businessroom meeting xD
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Great return guys, but can I make a suggestion going forward? Reduce the length of each round.
Asking A follow-up question in each round is ok, but not 2 or 3 in a single round, it makes things drag and you get bored.
But so glad Movie Fights is back."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"2 fighters better than 3. I like how this actually looks like a show now as opposed to people just bs'ing behind a desk.

Kudos"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,oh god they have to stand for so long. their knees must hurt
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,This is too different from the og movie fights
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,That predator pitch was legit. I hate Pirates of the Caribbean but it doesn’t mean that pirates as a concept aren’t cool.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Wonder Woman was way better than Thor
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,i liked thor's hammer.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,To me the best super hero movies this year are Logan and Thor Ragnarok.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Really glad movie fights is back....but...i agree with others ..brings back 3 fighters and let them sit down...have it far more informal than this...i think what was good about it was the group discussion feeling
This format is a mistake"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,I get why you want to change things but do you need to cha he the whole game?
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Fantastic job guys. Looking forward to the next episode.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Great to see you guys back! I thinks the ""too formal"" argument has weight. Keep it coming!"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I dont like this format, can we have the old show back just with a better Host"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Yes!
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Change is good
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Aw. Nice reformat but pls go back to the discussion fight vs game show style. People arguing at a table is what a lot of people do which is what made it relatable. Game show was a.nice try but stop. Imho
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,I just want 10 years worth of movie fights
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I looove the backwards fight idea! although bring back a third person and let them sit out and have a conversation, this isn't debate club"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Alicia Malone should be host
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Awesome that movie fights are back! But i would like to have 3 contestants again ;)
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,“Clone-gan” 😂😂
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Love it, thanks for coming back with Movie Fights, the pick the answer for your opponent was amazing!"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Yay glad you guys are back! I like the new setup, and really appreciate the intelligent questioning and dialogue interplay of the chat. I’d love to see guest hosts and comedian contestants on the show (Mark Ellis, Josh Macuga and definitely LON!) to help keep a good rhythm/flow of the show, if so this format could be a BBC-esque smart and fun debate show. Love it! You’re doing great for your first time back! Keep it up and keep it smart! 
P.S. Dan....I salute your awesome rock stance as you fight. Someone get that man a taller podium!"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,I think the fighters should have chairs
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,The show loses a lot with just two contestants
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Wonder Woman is just okay but shouldn't be considered for best superhero movie at all
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"everyone in the comments is complaining about the podiums and the lack of a 3rd fighter. But, I'm just glad you're back. And if you want to stand for an hour while you debate each other, go for it. Hal was great. Spencer and Dan were great. Roth and the other fact checker who's name escapes me at this moment was great. Have a nice winter break! X-mas. Hannukah. Whatever. Love you screen junkies crew!"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Fox disney crossover question was awesome , glad that Movie fights is back evan though it will take a little time to get used to the new format ."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,I’m down for this. Might be a little buggy here and there and might need a bit of a fix up here and there but loads of potential. Great to see this back. PS you can tell Joe was there watching by that laugh of his.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,I enjoyed the show but I do think the 3 fighter format would be better implemented in this format
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Things I enjoy:

- The side bars
     They give information in a concise format, and have a great aesthetic.

- Hal as judge
     Ten outta ten in general.

- Set aesthetic
     Love the cool feel, and proffesional tone.

Things I feel could be improved:

- # of fighters
    I feel that having three fighters allowed for more complex, or even interesting, ideas to be bounced on each other. Two feels like it could limit some of the fights.

- Standing/Podiums
   Not a huge complaint, but I feel that the show seems more stiff than the usual fights because of the standing. Not as much of a relaxing attitude that allowed for some humor. Seriousness is good, but I feel that a integrel part of the show was its relaxing, comfy atmospere.

Love the fact the show is coming back, and hope see some more as soon as possible!"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,I liked the old movie fights format more to be honest.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"loved it, cant wait for more. Happy holidays!"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"i think you the idea of three judges one of them being the live viewers is awesome.
i would change it a bit though..
the two screen junkies judges on set should say who they believe won the fight and you should go to fans for the tie breaker.
i think this makes a lot more sense and would be a better choice in cases like we saw before in movie fights when a much newer film is going up against a classic or less popular movie."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I like the table so much more, this feels too formal. Go back to the table please"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I enjoyed this episode, but I’m not sure I like this new format as much as the old one. I feel like the idea was to streamline the show a bit, which I understand, but I also enjoyed the longer, more conversational format from before. However, that’s just my opinion. I’m excited to see where you guys take this and I’ll continue to support!"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I found the agressiveness of Movies Fights past to grate on me, this one was more fun. I'll tune in for more"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,How come there are only two contestants? Feels awkward
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Hal is suitable for a moderator/judge, but the lack of a third fighter make these fights too tame. While the overloaded amount of toys in the former fights was childish and distracting, this setting was too sterile. At least have a desk for a comfy round and some warm colours and posters in the background."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Thor was fun I liked it, but Logan and Wonder Woman meant more to me so I bought the blu-ray LOL"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Not going to lie, Dan's pitch for a Pirates of the Caribbean/Predator movie is awesome!!!!!!"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Uh, guys, it's in the name. How much of a spoiler can it be that in a movie about Ragnarok, Asgard gets destroyed? I haven't seen it yet, but that was no surprise at all."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"3 contestants.
Sitting not standing.
No fan vote
Old format with Hal hosting.

Etc, etc."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Agree with everyone here...old format was much better.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,I’m loving the new format! Can’t wait to watch more!
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,I personally adore this format and look forward to more! Keep it up you wonderful people!
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I love Spencer and Dan! Both intelligent and very respectful to each other! Yes i do prefer the previous format but I love the 3 judges, and I like Hall! Ruth is great too! It will be great if different people are judges like Alicia, she bring so much to this show !  I like that the public has a vote but i would not like that the score is dependent on thefan factor and not the sharpness of the arguments! Anyways happy that the show is back! ❤️"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,I was hoping this would come back but wow. I like change but this is just weird. Looks like I have to bring cartoon fights back 👌
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Here's my critique on the new format: Positives: I LOVE the rundown. I've been wanting that for the longest time. KEEP THAT not matter what. Also, I love the scoreboard. Has a sporting even feel and you can begin watching anytime and know who's winning. And I like the new scoring system. Makes the viewers feel like they're important to the show and eliminates the ""rigged"" notion from the one judge system. Negatives: HATE the podiums. I get that you're trying to make this look organized but this makes me think I'm watching a political debate and makes it too formal and not loose and fun. This also wouldn't work when you bring in guest fighters like Kevin Smith or Seth Rogan. Also, the color palate for the set sucks. This looks like the Ellen Degeneres show set. This is Movie Fights. There should be movie posters on the wall. Now I don't hate the one on one format, but it does take away from the zaniness that tents to happen with 3, and even sometimes 4 fighters. I can live with this as long as you loose the formal setting.  Suggestions: Bring back the bell. You don't have to use Andy's hammer but someone just saying TIME just doesn't work. Plus it gives a boxing feel to a fight. Also, a more energetic host. I like Hal, but his jokes are lame and he interrupts too much. And, bring in a roundtable. Gives the option for more fighters and keeps it chill and fun. You know, watching this fight, it just seemed like they were walking on eggshells a little, trying not to push the envelope. But that's just boring. Cut loose guys, let 'er rip."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I like this new style, however, maybe limit Hal (or who ever hosts) to maybe 1 or 2 additional questions per point questions."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Can we edit in different pants/legs on Hal's podium every movie fights now?
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,I miss the old movie fights format. Nothing about this is better. Two fighters is boring. Audience should never ever get a vote because they will never listen to the argument fairly.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Thank you all for a great show. Love Hal as host. The comically big podium made him look so tiny, though. Love the crew laughing in the background."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"This 7 round shorter version is amazing! I loved it. I think the 2 fighter thing could be a cool new idea that we are just not used to yet. But please bring the table back with the judge in the middle and the two fighters on the sides.

Love you guys and keep up the great work!"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Hope they have OSHA approved ergonomic mats to stand on. Get these cats some stools
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Things I liked: I like Hal as a judge and the questions he was asking as follow up were solid because they didn't really favor one contestant over the other. I like that Roth and Hal really explained their answers instead of just saying how tough it was. 

The things I didn't like: I prefer the table to the podiums. It just felt more casual and laid back, which is great for a show like this. I think after using this and a few one on one fights, that the one on one fights should be for the belt alone. The three person set up is way more fun and you get multiple arguments. The multiple arguments are important to me because it keeps one person from trouncing on the other and controlling the whole fight. With a third voice in there, there's a lesser chance that happens."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Say 2018 is coming
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Logan is not only the best super hero movie of 2017 but the best movie of 2017.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"It would be out of Wonder Woman, Logan and Thor Ragnarok. I feel like Wonder Woman and Thor are more rewatchable and enjoyable but Logan really hits you"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Love the new montage!
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I really enjoyed this new fighting style but I do miss the three fighters and the bell sounds, also I hated Thor Ragnarok and Logan was the best superhero movie of 2017"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,OMFG! I am SO glad that Movie Fights is back!!! Hell Damn YES!
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"My take on 2017's superhero movies:

Logan: Phenomenal. Paced and acted incredibly well. Easily the best superhero film of 2017. Heck, it's barely a superhero movie. It's more of a postapocalyptic drama that just happens to involve a superhero. I'd nominate Hugh and Stewart for Oscars.

Ragnarok: Hell of a fun movie. Loved the lighter, but still serious, take on the Thor films and I feel it's the best of the three. Plus, the use of Led Zeppelin's ""Immigrant Song"" twice elevated the movie even more.

Wonder Woman: Fantastic. Gal was awesome as the title character and Patty Jenkins brought a breath of fresh air to DC in the franchise's only good movie in its canon. The DK trilogy is the best, but that isn't technically DC. 

Homecoming: Very, very fun. Holland is my favorite Spider-Man, with Maguire doing the best at the nerdy Peter aspect. Keaton was fantastic as the villain.

Guardians 2: Very fun film. The soundtrack and action were both great and the characters are likable as ever. Had a great time watching it.

Justice League: Seeing it Monday. Heard it's fun but a meh movie overall.

In a nutshell: Marvel proved it can go above and beyond, and is incredibly consistent with the quality of their films. DC showed promise with WW, but destroyed some of that progress with JL and has shown that is still inconsistent and can't get a grip on what they need to do."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,How does this feel so scripted?
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I like Hal as the host, interesting follow up questions that add more depth to the fight ie the lightsaber question"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I honestly don’t mind the 2 fighters, they constantly complained about ‘going long’ and the 1 hour format lets people discuss more, with less questions. Also means that if they manage to bring on celeb fighters it fits better with an hourly schedule that a lot of them seem to have.

I really prefer the cluttered desk to the ‘slick’ podiums though. We don’t need yet more political style debating. More like two friends fighting on a comfy couch while a movie plays in the background."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,I would like to see it a little more casual and conversational still but I like it.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I miss the table, it was cozier."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Bring back 3 fighters
Bring back the friendly fight setting (like sitting around a table had).

I have no interest in a debate format in a game show setting."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I miss the three competitors formula. I do love to see you guys back. Hope Hal eases into it he was a bit stiff, or give Roxy the gavel she know how to rock that bad boy already."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Disney - Fox crossover. Star Wars and Alien. A bunch of Aliens end up on the death star, Darth Vader roam around and kill them all."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"This was great but I will echo what many others have already said, I miss the more casual look and feel of the 3-way fights with everyone sitting together at one table. This setup looks too formal and stiff."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Thor doesn’t deserve any Oscar nomination lol ! Logan and Wonder Woman do deserve one
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"The show wasn't broken, don't fix it. Just replace the judge and go back to the old style. You're going to drive viewers away."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Thor was ruined by jokes every freacking second can’t be serious for a sec
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,I am so glad Movie Fights is back! I was starting to think it would never return and I used to look forward to it every week. Thanks for bringing it back. The new scoring system makes sense. Will it always be two players?
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,wow Christmas came early. Thankyou SJ. I thought MF was finished
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Lets give this new format a chance, maybe like 3 episode, maybe it will grow on us.. they can easily go back to the old format if most of the audience didn't like this format.."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Thumbs up on the new voting system, thumbs down on the two fighters. I totally get the fact that this streamlines the rules and probably makes running the show easier, but I do think three players brought more out of some of the fighters. It's early days though, so I'm willing to see more episodes to test if this format works in the long run."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,DAN THE MAN!!!!
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"The Superhero movie I enjoyed the most was ""Thor Ragnarok"". Logan depressed the crap out of me."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Seems kinda biased toward Dan
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Go back to having 3 people please. Also, there's too much stuff on the screen. Looks like CNN."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Great to see you guys back.  Was a little skeptical of the format at first (I liked the chaotic nature of the original), but I came around at the end.  Look forward to many more of these!"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,I'm so glad you all brought back Movie Fights
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"yes I was missing this so much, lets celebrate movie fights is back, I agree with Thor ragnarok,  I love Logan for what it is, I would love to read the comic book is based on, and hopefully see a hulk vs wolverine since Disney has the rights, also Logan has a movie reference that my dad saw but to be honest, it was pretty dim, I would have to say Spiderman homecoming, my second is thor, Logan, wonder woman, justice league.  don't miss with die hard its dead, no coming back, I would do Simpson movie sequel with Star Wars make a movie that has tropes of both, that would be cool but the crossover I would like to see hulk vs wolverine movie since the birth of comics of wolverine came from that, for me its a tie, I would love to see both, die hard for zootopia almost a spoof I would like to be honest I mean they were going to make fun of spy movies like James Bond early on, and the predator and pirates good research, that would be dope. why didn't dan say do a adaptation of the comic book predator 1718, that would be both arguments, actually a have another idea, is Simpson and die hard they can make a real Mcbain movie from the Simpsons franchise, do and early movie, that would be dope. anyways it would be a Simpson sequel since the Simpson are in the plaza, that Mcbain saves. I'm not a big Star Wars guy so I don't care, who ever got the best points I guess."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,I like the new direction! Feels a bit slower than the old stuff but I'm sure you guys will sort out the kinks soon.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,dan has a good point that the girl in logan should get a supporting actress nod.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I dont think it's The ""3 fighter format is what I miss as much as The more relaxed felling that fit ya'll's personality's. Miss the feeling of spontaneity, comedy, chaos and surprises that comes with sitting down and just talking shit. This looks and feels like the things I'd think you guys would want to get away from in a show like this: a presidential debate/a daytime game show. Brings down the pace and tonality. To bad cuz the show and you guys are just as funny as before. Just gets lost in this setting."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Three fighters can be chaotic, but -- two fighters drains the energy out of the room. Too controlled."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Good show but i do prefer the more laid back free for all movie fights. The new format is fine but it's a bit more confining and less diverse argument-wise and I think I'm not the only one that thinks Hal's tangents are overwhelming and annoying
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I think the two people format just needed some time to get used to, but have them sit please"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,What a great way to restart Movie Fights! Great combatants fighting over interesting arguments. Loved it so much that I voted even after the Live show was over.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Very much enjoy the new show. Hal makes a great host! Give him more on Screen Junkies!!!!
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I really like this version of Movie Fights way more than before! By the way, I said Ron Burgundy for the Jedi question lol"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Anyone got the round times?
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Where's the other host? He sick?
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Liked the show guys but can we get these guys a stool :)
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"""Clonegan"" ahahaha."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,I think they may want to rethink have them stand for the whole match.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Dan Murrel is hilarious in this, the Fawn McClane takedown was magnifique lol"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,I’m so happy that movie fights is back again 🍿 kinda miss the old format of 3 fighters because it felt a lot more like 3 friends talking about their favourite movie but I’m so happy that this is back with a bang 🎉 and Logan was amazing 😉
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Spiderman: Homecoming? No...?
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I loved the new format. It feels a lot more professional and less casual. Plus, I feel like judgments were made just to extend the fight in the previous style. This new format somewhat prevents that."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,The set seems pretty cold. I miss the toys and the fan stuff. The sound makes it seem like you're in a big empty room. The room is too dark. Doesn't match the feel of the new logo
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,They rebooted
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,I like this new format :)
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,I love Hal forcing the debaters to improv. Keeps them on their toes.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"i dont hate the format. i think its good for a more intense fight, or series of fights ie a 1v1 fight for the belt or a tournament to determine a top contender for the belt. but outside of that i would have to agree with some of the other comments; standing behind podiums feels a little too formal and serious as opposed to the old set up of sitting around the table which had a more friendly and casual atmosphere which (combined with having 3 fighters) lends itself to funnier arguments and more entertaining fights.
i dont mind the fan vote, as long as the results dont become a popularity contest. i know in the past there have been a lot of instances of the polls being a popularity contest, but that was the twitter polls, in which anyone could vote regardless of whether or not they were watching, not the live youtube polls. and since the youtube polls are only available to those watching live, i dont see it becoming as big a problem as it was before"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,i miss that warm living room vibe with all the toys.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Hal's a great as ringleader and I like the 3 judge format, and I'll watch no matter what, BUT I really feel just having 2 fighters kills something I just can't pin point. Give us 3 fighters, put Hal to the left a la Alec T. and you'll have a better MFs. Whoa!"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,New format is awesome great show! Glad movie fights is back
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,I love the new format but miss the three fighters. got more diverse points of view and the fighters constantly ganging up on each other was hilarious
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,I loved this and it was fantastic to just see u all back and I still wanna make it my goal to appear on this show. One day one day. But I will miss the old format but I think change is a good thing and it will be a new start for everyone. I hope Dan will be at his Dan Cam but still fight time to time. I hope u have a set host except for Classic Movie Fights with Alicia Malone (P.S please in the future bring that back) but for the majority have a set host. Also I didn’t like the blue bit around the bottom but was find but found blue bit pointless. But I thought this was amazing and I loved that Spencer and dan went head to head love the polls being more involved in the decision making and the fact you have three judges thought that was great and it will stop with people sayin its bias (which I never thought anyway) but I enjoyed seeing u all together debating films again it was lovely but see u all in 2018 with this show and well done everyone from Billy to Lon to Spencer etc we can tell u have all worked so hard and will continue too on making a fantastic show for all us nerds to watch hehe glad ur back guys
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,I would like to see both fighters in the same frame so y'all don't have to cut back and forth to see their reactions to the arguments. Lighting also seems kinda dim? Love the new graphics. Having the bell back or other sound bites will make the transitions less dry. Overall just glad y'all are back :)
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Please go back to 3 fighters. Don't like the public voting on the points, that's a popularity contest not a good way to award points."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,The Last Jedi was good too
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Great to have you all back. I missed Movie Fights!
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Personally wish there was a bit of background music
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Hate the new format.  I get that they want to distance themselves from Andy and what he built, but this was too drastic of a change from the original format.  The ""Game Show"" look and and 2 person format is a bad fit for a debating/arguing game, and seems so much less personal than the old format.  Get Alicia as host.  Hal is fine, but Alicia is the best."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Movie fights is back!
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"way too formal - with only 2 fighters who are standing and no mayhem it's just boring.   
it realy doesn't feel you guys had any fun this time."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"i don;t see keven smith standing in like you guys for one hour , change it back or do something comfortable so celebrty can come"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Say “ I crucified my hamster” it sounds wierd but it should sound funny
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Can u plz do airplane honest trailera
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Have to admit I liked the old format better. However I think Sal is a good choice for host and I'm sure this will improve with time :)
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I like it (here comes the), but I believe this format is more prone to feel dry because of the one-on-one nature of the fight. This time it was good, but it also was a best case scenario because of the two people fighting being the best fighters."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I love the old format. This new format is a little boring, and the old format allowed for some absolutely hilarious moments. I hope you guys can bring it back."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Agree with others that I prefer to see the fighters sitting down...adds a nice casual atmosphere. I think the colder lighting hurts the product a bit too, again its giving me more formal vibes. BLADE RUNNER FRANK LLOYD WRIGHT TILES THO NICE JOB GUYS"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Glad to see Andy gone. Glad to see Dan and Spence back. I do think giving the fans a vote is a mistake. Most fan voting is for the picks and not for the arguments.  
Hal did a great job as host. Excited to see more. 
I'm hesitant about only having 2 fighters at a time. I feel like it will be more competitive which is fine, but less opportunity for cross talk comedy and laughing. But I may be wrong. 
Just happy to have movie fights back"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Good to see movie fights return! Congrats on the new format guys! One suggestion I would have is to try to keep the show around or under an hour. I loved the old format, but finding time for a 1.5-2 hour show can be difficult for some. Keep up the good work!"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,I preferred 3 fighters and miss the nerdy crap scattered about and i would like to see a continuation of the part where the fighters bladders are about explode
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Was hoping for Roxy to host.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,The new montage is awesome. Change is good.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Glad the show's back. I do have to say that I prefer the old format, and I'm entirely against public vote or a general consensus in the context of a controlled debate/fight. With that said, I welcome any innovative change to the show, as a fan I'm glad they're making them. Keep it up Screen Junkies."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Surprised to see that I seem to be in the minority here, but I'm digging the new format!"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Wow. In the third round when Dan was argumenting and pulling so much details out of his head! Damn, I was like - go Dan! 
I didn´t even realize how much I missed this show. :) Great job you guys. :) I have to say, I enjoyed when 3 fighters did the show just a little bit more, but still great show. I can´t wait for more. :)"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Best Superhero Movie of 2017? The question should be: what was the least horrible crappy Superhero Movie of 2017? Slapstick Ragnarök to shitty Injustice League, teleportation Wonderwoman with bad CGi to forced humor on GTG, Boring Logan to jennifer connelly+s voice. Worst superhero year in a long time. Thank God we still have Agents of Shield, the best TV show did save some of the year."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Hal is awesome
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Please make Dan's Pirate movie
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Very impressed with how you guys have rebuilt this show. Welcome back!
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,1min in and im sorry to say that im not a big fan of the lay out but lets see how it goes. Nobody likes change anyway.

u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Great to see you guys back... everything is rather good, thought felt a little formal.. sit down *shrug*... Hal is brilliant"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Like that there are more judges not just one guy making all the decisions but p.s bring back three people but I understand this is a battle between the two
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Go back to the old way
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I love that Hal is asking questions of these guys to force them to think outside of their arguments.  He's acting more like a mediator and less like a ""feed only what you want to judge.""  This seems like a good format when you have guests on the show.  Well done guys."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,I like some of the changes but I wish you guys kept the three people at a table system. A huge part of the reason I loved Movie Fights is the vibe of a fun hectic discussion between friends. This feels much more like like a debate than a wrestling match. And Movie Fights is definitely a wrestling match.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"""Ugggh! Blood, blood, death, cancer"" - Spencer Gilbert, 2017

I quite like the new format but I do kind of think it's a bit too formal. The idea of having Hal ask extra questions during the fights is good though."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"HAL is brilliant as always, lads are good, weak point is the girls. They just don't fit in, need to recast them"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Movie Fights returns - so Christmas miracles do happen. Great to see it back, but it will take some time to get used to this new two-fighter standing format."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,yeeeees i was thinking this might never come back. soooo happy
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"That was a lot of fun. 
I got discovered you guys via Honest Trailers but didn't start paying attention till the...revamp. After that you guys became my first foray into the World of You Tube shows.
Since then I have been watching and enjoying your content on a whole other level of interest and enjoyment but had never seen a Movie Fight. Really liked it. I had Spencer taking the first round but thought Dan really took over after that. Fair play! I would watch both crossovers - but only if they took out the Hans Grouper character; this must remain unsullied by parody."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"It's nostalgic seeing you guys doing this... Hal, Spencer, Dan... takes me back. But please, add another fighter, and go back to sitting down. Be comfortable... it's an hour long."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I agree with other comments that this new format is a bit too formal, both in its visual layout and structure. The podiums as well as the back and forth debate questions take away a bit of the personable quality and atmosphere that the old format had. Oddly enough I think the bit of chaos of the old format made it more enjoyable to watch. If there is a middle ground between the two, I think that would make viewers happy."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I echo a lot of what has already been said. I totally understand the reasons behind re-vamping, and im sure any change will take some adjustment. However, I also enjoyed the organic feel and nature of the old format. The old way may have been more chaotic, less organized, and even maybe less ""fair"", but it had more energy and personality. 

I think the current format may be a little too debatecentric. I think most fans watched movie fights to experience and enjoy the people. I also agree that the 3 fighter format was better. Whatever system brings back the energy and the Screen Junkie personality is what i'd like to see!

Either way I love and support you guys! 

PS. Hal is a great judge but I think Roxy is the best!"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I NEVER comment on YouTube videos but wanted to take a second to let you know what I liked and disliked on the new format.

Overall a little disappointing return (this coming from someone who didn't enjoy the previous guy's onscreen presence - even before everything came out). It does time some time to get used to new things, so I'm not jumping ship yet. However, there were 3 things that lead to my disappointment, listed in order of importance.
1. The visuals of the stage. It looked like a political debate which was probably the point, but it came across very cold and less friendly than when everyone was sitting around the table. I can understand the desire for a visual change, but I think that could still be accomplished by making other changes and leaving the sitting around the table vibe going. 
2. Two fighters. I'm still thinking through this one. In the long run I may end up liking this better but for now, I wish there was a third contestant. Hard pressed to say exactly why though if I'm honest.
3. Some of Hal's questions in the middle of the arguments were strange and took the fight into a weird place (ie the monologue question).

Things I liked
1. 3 main questions and then 4 speed round questions. This worked well for me.
2. Roth and Danielle were great on the sideline (though I love when Danielle is a competitor)
3. I think the new scoring is ""more fair"" and less at the whims of 1 person. Roth (that position) obviously has the most sway, but can still be outvoted if the other ""two"" disagree with her. Also I agreed with every decision Roth made. I would like to see the judges have to ""lock"" in their decision before the other judges give their vote to ensure there are no shenanigans.
4. I loved Dan's point about having fun and arguing these movies without getting to a nasty point. Much more enjoying able."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"The ADVANTAGE OF 3 FIGHTERS:  it adds more of a 'movie nerds arguing in the basement' feel that is so relatable for us all.  It also provides more on-set laughing, joking, and interaction between the contestants.  All that being said.  Welcome back Movie Fights! I've missed you and I'll always remain a fan"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I kind of agree with the others, you should let the fighters sit down! Also, I don’t know if it’s just me but the lighting seems a bit harsh."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,I love this new format. It's so much saner!
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"If they do insist on sticking to this new format then I think they should do what the schmoedown has done and have different belts. Have the regular belt, a classic belt, Fantasy Sci-fi, etc. Would get people excited for there being entire matches dedicated to a genre of movies they are passionate about and give certain fighters advantages in what they are passionate in. It would switch things up from having the same couple fighters dominating the game."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Honestly you can't really compare Thor Ragnarok and Logan because Thor was more of a comedy and Logan took more of a serious tone in my opinion they don't really compare besides being a superhero movie

u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Thank you Spencer for recommending Search Party. I love it.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I'm really glad movie fights are back. I think you've changed too much, I prefer the old set and 3 fighters but you did good with the 3 ""judges""."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,old format please. limit this format for championship battles.

u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Hal's questioning around 17min is great.  Challenging the fighters' opinions and platform.  Well done, man."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,I just want to echo what a few others have said. The new format is way too formal. It felt like a presidential debate. It should feel like friends hanging out.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Thanks for brining this sho back. I like haveing three judges and I understand the need for making changes and a fresh start. I would rather 3 fighters then 2, but great job screen junkies."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"echoing lot of comments here:

bring back 3 fighters
keep Hal as judge
fighters should sit and be comfortable
Like the short follow up questions Hal does
3 judges is a good idea

Keep it as casual as it can be and fun

Great too see you all back"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Just give it time, guys."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I see a lot of hate for the new two person format, just wanna say that I enjoy it a lot, it's less chaotic. Sometimes at three, one was clearly left undermine and the fighters had a lot more to talk about since they had to defend their movie, but also crap on two others. Now, it's really easier to compare between only two and say why your movie is better. Also, three judges is a really great idea, it takes away the ""personnal"" factor that one judge could have of like, voting for his or hers personnal opinion instead of the argument. And only three questions is enough, with the speed round, i think this is a nearly perfect format. The standing does remind me of a game show and might be tiring for the contestant and the audience as vote is not that bad, you should however write ""Dan or Spencer"" instead of the movies, because people will just vote for their favorite movie and it won't be base on the argument. Anyway, good show glad movie fights is back ! :)"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Wonder Woman > Thor > Logan > Spiderman Homecoming > GOTG2 > Justice League
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I really loved the old format, and thought this felt a bit too formal and not conversational. Idk. Hal is an amazing host though, and i love this panel!"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"This was awesome, at first i tough, yeah spencer give up the belt, you know Dan deserves it, he beat you without any gimmics, just arguments and facts, but then i remembered that you had to go poop the whole game, so... maybe who wins is not so obvious after all, still, i´m a Dan fanboy so i shouldn´t have a valid opinion xD"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,LOGAN!!!!!!
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I like the new montage. The one part I truly miss though is the iconic Ken Watanabe ""Let them fight"". When you do the next montage, please bring it back."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,New show was awesome wouldn’t want it to come back any other way. Hal is a great host. And judging by the comments I guess I’m the only one that likes the 2 fighters
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Really like the new format. I know it’s a test run but Speed round time keeping could use some work. For instance the first Speed round Spencer got 36 seconds to Dan’s 25. Both should have had 20 seconds. 
Overall, could speed rounds just be 30 seconds with 15 second rebuttals. Spencer’s 36 seconds felt sufficient."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Bring back the old format!
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,is tv fights coming back too?
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Format and set change suck.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"when the audience votes come from Twitter, they're a popularity contest. Hopefully if they only come from YouTube they'll be more accurate and from people who are actually paying attention. I also personally prefer sitting to standing, but I do think varying the number of fighters could be cool. Sometimes 2, sometimes 3, sometimes the tournament style with 8 or whatever."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I really enjoyed this episode and I see most of the changes as beneficial. That said, three fighters system was WAY more dynamic."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"No joke, that Pirates/Predator crossover needs to happen."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Welcome back, Movie Fights!"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Great show. I like the new judge voting format a lot, I think it's an improvement over the host being the only judge. The two fighters standing change didn't really bother me in comparison to 3 fighters in the past,  it allows better fights on those arguments because there's not a 3rd idea to pull focus, although I would sometimes enjoy the way 3 fighters interact so I could go either way."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Came here to just say I have a big crush on Dan. I don't see a ring on that finger, boy! #thirsty #gooddaysir"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,I like this new format a lot! Hal makes a great host and I like the more formal nature of it.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"mhh , I do not like the new format. The set feels cold and unpersonal , I never feel like its fun to hang out with the people on Screen , like I used to. Standing instead of sitting plays a big part in that. Three fighters always meant three different perspectives , where also a weird but fun one could be thrown in. mhhh. Sad to say , but I dont think I will stick with this... previously watched every single Episode :(
well , they are sitting in 4s on news :P"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Yay Dan!!
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Do emojis
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,I was a bigger fan of the old format. But I am just glad to have this back at all.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I liked the new format, seems a bit more fair, one question though, will it always be only 2 people debating?"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,die hard as kids movie is pretty stupid
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I love you guys, but I hated this.
I get trying to completely revamp, BUT
1. The logo, did everyone really like that logo?
2. The podiums. Is the idea to never have outside guests anymore?
Because I don’t know who would want to stand at a podium arguing for that long besides Dan (no offense, I love you).
3. Only two panelists, again, no more outside guests? That feels like a long argument rather than an open discussion.
4. Rotating hosts? I’m hoping
If there’s no more TV Fights, I’m hoping for Roxy (even though I like her a lot more as a fighter).

That said.
I like the idea of less rounds, to make it go by faster.
Pretty much hate everything else.

I hope you guys read these and good luck."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Personally, the set seems lifeless and something totally unlike the Screen Junkies would make or have for a set. For example, the Screen Junkies News set is colorful and unique but fitting to this channel's character, which makes the video more fun to watch! I love this show to bits and I'm very happy its back with two of my favorite fighters, but I just wish they would carry on with the old set. I understand it probably feels tainted or might be even hard to look at the same, but it's that set we are comfortable with and enjoy, regardless of who's there, or in this case who's not there. Whatever they do from here I understand, but this is just my own personal preference."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Good first go at the new format. Glad to see Movie Fights back and the judging not afraid to give out points properly. At time i felt Andy gave lame reasons to give people points in order to add length to the fight. I like the question structure and judging in the new format. I do miss having a third competitor. Maybe having a third can be tested in a future episode? The new format may not have the over the top energy as the original but i'll take that over it just being a shouting match.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Yes!!!
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Now for Flick Bait!
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I like the new format, not a fan of the stage though... little too formal and bland. Sitting down I think would definately be better, and maybe a stage/background a little more like the original, only in the sense of feeling more wholesome and chill."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I actually really like this new format. It feels like more organized and it still had a lot of fun moments. I really like Hal as the host.  It’s a different kind of energy and I dig it. I don’t think the three person fight would work in this new format. As much as I enjoyed the table and three people fighting it out, it always felt really easy to see which fighter was gonna get knocked out and who were the two last standing. It always felt a little awkward to me when that third person gets knocked out and just sits there listening to the other two fight it out. So that’s just my opinion. 

I just want to applaud you guys for moving forward and bringing back a show I really love. I can’t for more movie fights in 2018!"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,What movie does Dan suggest at 19:23
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Logan set up so many great elements (the adamantium ""silver bullet"" as a tie-in to the werewolf metaphor; the god-father of mutant-hood becoming it's greatest nemesis as a result of old age and disease; the passing of the mantle of X-person to the new generation)... and then shit all over itself with the third act.  Sorry, I don't see why people love this movie so much."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Glad to see this show back after some rought times, people! 
I like the new format, and hope to keep seeing more fun movie debates with you!"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Glad to see Movie Fights back in action!
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,I haven't watched the video but I'm going with best superhero movie as Spider-Man homecoming
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,i find myself board watching this now. i really miss the 3 fighter format and the old energy. 2 out of 10. i feel like I'm watching 2 kids make fun of each others picks. no one cares about the worriers 3. lol
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I like some of the new Movie Fights elements, and I miss some of the old elements. Hopefully there will be a way to meet in the middle. Rooting for you guys!"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"How come you guys didn't keep it the same and just get a new judge,this is boring"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Spencer’s take on Logan is eye gougingly stupid.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Live Free or Die Hard was PG-13 and one of the best in the series. Probably the best since Die Hard.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Love that movie fights is back,  im sure you guys will figure out a way to make it better than before 
But for now im just glad to have something to listen to on the road 🍻"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"its great to finally see movie fights again. still, gotta say 3 fighters was more fun... also sitting down seemed more casual"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,love the new set up
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Love hearing Joe laugh in the background :P
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Says to get it on iTunes podcast app but it’s not there?
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Love that the show is back, only real issue is that I thought the information panels on the side and bottom of the screen were unnecessary and a little distracting."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"not sure about this format yet. I think Spencer, Hal, and Dan made it entertaining but Im not sure how much Id like it with less entertaining guests"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,So who won
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Dan gets way too heated in these things now. It honestly makes it kind of hard to watch knowing he'll be pissed if he loses.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Guys, it's obviously Captain Underpants"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,DO THOR RAGNAROK HONEST TRAILER NEXT!!!!! PLEASEEEEE
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Love Movie Fights coming back! :)
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,You guys definitely listened. Hal is a great choice as the new host. But I do hope it goes back to 3 people fighting and not 2. I feel like all the other changes worked well
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,To even have Thor in the same league as Logan is disrespectful. Thor is the mud on Logan shoes
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,this is good! but imo just bring chairs back.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Bring back 3 ppl. 2 is not better. More people = more chaos.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Gilbert's funny style clashes with Murrel's too serious debating style. I'd rather see funny contestants. I'm always worried Murrell will burst an artery in his head because he is too intense.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,I want Xenomorphs in Star Wars
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"There are a lot of comments on the format (2 fighters, standing up). I think it really comes down to the framing. It is very top heavy."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,That Zootopia pitch sounds like an abortion of a movie and I cannot fathom why anyone would want to watch that.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"My biggest complaint is with the display graphics. The screen is way too busy for what they're doing. The question queue on the left is completely unnecessary. They don't even fill the space fully and it wastes valuable real estate on the screen. If you're going to show the current question on the bottom of the screen anyways then the short version on the left is just a redundancy. There was no issue with going to the description for questions if you wanted to look ahead. That feature would be better served if consolidated in a new bottom screen banner and not distributed around the screen. I'd rather see the fighters full screen with graphics superimposed and not a shrunken screen with all this needless clutter. Then that ""Interact live on twitter"" is so out of place and distracting to me. I get that it's just the bottom by their hands, but if you are going to waste the screen space to separate the actual video from the information display then do it and keep them distinctly apart. This third floating rectangle doesn't fit with the text or color of the left display, and it doesn't fit with the text or color of the bottom display either. It's just kinda there and I hate it. Get rid of the left display, and consolidate the twitter plug to the bottom banner.

I also just don't really like the new set in general. It's dark and lacking in personality with all the squares everywhere. I would just put up some shelves and pack them with movie boxes or action figures like they do with every other set. Also add some chairs to the podiums. From a body language perspective a person sitting at a table is far more comfortable looking and inviting than someone standing behind a podium and constantly having to shift from leg to leg uncomfortably. Having it be an option to sit or stand would be the way to go.

It also lacked that casual feeling of sitting around the table and talking about movies. Old Movie Fights had the tendency to go off the rails, but it had nothing to do with the format of the show. It was a shit judge letting people get out of hand. All Movie Fights really needed was a judge who could keep people on topic and some rules banning stuff like the racist/sexist argument or the Spencer tactic of putting words in your mouth. The comedy is fine, but when you start applying someone else's ideas to the original pitch you're being a bad judge. seaQuest DSV was a great answer, Spencer joked about it, Andy let it ruin his judgement despite not actually being part of the actual pitch.

Overall I enjoyed the content of the episode. I will hold off on my official opinion of the format until I've seen a few more people on. Someone like a Mike Carlson might liven up the game and bring some levity into the show. The Dan vs. Spencer fight was good. Hal was fine other than asking Dan for the pirate/predator bromance conversation. That was the classic Spencer putting words in your mouth tactic where the actual argument presented gets undercut by the fabricated apparent argument. To me this really felt like an overcorrection in the format and a misfire on the set dressing. Other than that it's not too different in actual content or function to really complain about. I preferred the 3 fighter elimination style to the best of 7 style, but I'll give this the fair shot it deserves. There is nothing preventing them from adjusting the format as they see fit. Any tweaks or changes can be made at literally any time. If this was the beta test for the 2018 season then this is my feedback. Take from it what you will."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I want to see a live action Lilo and Stitch, but its a Xenomorph instead of a little blue alien. That's the Disney/Fox crossover we deserve!"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I actually like the 2 person format a lot. Yes it is similar to Schmoedown, but as someone who got into podcasts and vidcasts like this because of Movie Fights, I started to drift away toward Schmoedown because the records weren't there, and it didn't feel like any of these fights were building toward anything. Records being wiped, and allowing people to go 1vs1 means this format can build towards a watch every week show. 
If it means we don't have a 3rd fighter, I'm ok with that. If you can find a middle ground where there are 3 fighters and fights build into a league more, I think you'll find that pleases the most fans."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"They should bring back the ""instant knockout"" rule. Spencer would have won it on ""the misery porn of Logan""."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"If you guys are gonna continue this three main fight format, then I think the current format of questions works REALLY well. First, an analytical question that's about arguing why x is better/worse/whatever than y, Second a Pitch question and Third a special round, that mixes it up. Scrap Trick Questions, and start doing more backward fights, or maybe a round that your answer gets picked by your opponent, or really just anything to mix it up, like a wildcard round."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"While I miss the old format, I do like the new one. Andy as judge was so heavily linked to that old format that I can understand the revamp."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"This feels like a presidential debate, my only criticism is there should be three fighters and Yalls should be sitting. Be comfortable, reason I liked the show was cause it was informal, buncha friends sitting down arguing about movies. I also prefer the five questions and then five speed round questions, but that's just cause it provides more content."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Loved the new format! The new judging system is awesome, especially the inclusion of the viewers. Hal makes a great host and I love his questions to stir the fight a little bit, I think it really helps the structures of the fight and brings in new perspectives and arguments. I'm also really looking forward to seeing Danielle on the couch every week! (Is it now the Dan & Danielle Cam? The DaniDan Cam? The double Dan cam? The Dan x 2 Cam? I'm getting carried away, sorry.) The set will take some getting used to, but I like the frame with an overview, I think it'll be really helpful for people like me who like to skip fights if they don't know anything about the movies or the topic. It'll make it easier to keep track of the points. Basically I can't wait for movie fights to be weekly again!! :D"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,I really want to go back to the three person setup.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Spencer as Hans Grouper really got me.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,While I miss the 3 person format I really liked Hal as a judge!
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I think it should have been Alien vs. Predator Vs. Pirates of The Carribean and Johnny Depp and his crew get involved in the middle of a fight between Pred and Xenos in a hidden location ""what can only be found if you know what you're looking for"" where a treasure like the fountain of youth or el dorado is located.  The pirates are after the treasure and fighting to survive as the aliens and the xenos are fighting eachother and slaughtering the pirates.  PG-13 since its more or less a Pirates movie and the Pred and Xenos are a plot device."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,will it be available in audio podcast form?
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,3-way fights please champion v champion is cool but 3-way fights
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I feel like it's a bit too awkward now with this setup. Also it should be fun, the arguments get too serious sometimes."

u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,I would totally watch Pirates/Predator
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,I've missed Movie Fights. Thank you so much for bringing them back.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Now with 100% less sexual harassment
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Dan is the best!.  love the new set up of Movie Fights
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"One on One feels a little empty to me, glad movie fights is back but would prefer if it went back to three way."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I won't say it ruins the game for me, but I will definitely miss the three fighter set up. It was more of a discussion."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Logan was the best
you don't have to watch the video now"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,I'm big fan of the show i like the old format. I also enjoy the show with the regulars of the show as opposed to bringing in guests. I'll keep watching tho keep up the good work.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"i thought we'd never see another movie fights ever again, and now its back it looks like a political debate"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,yeah the visual format is kinda formal. put back the table and chairs. it's more relax and easy to watch that way :) but overall I'm happy mf is back
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I think that the best way to balance the new format and old format, is to alternate them. Do this once a fortnight, a well-mannered two person DEBATE about films, and then the older format with three fighters FIGHTING(with words) about films. Because I like both formats myself. I think that this format suits the more DEBATE side of Movie Fights, so Classic Fights and whatnot, whereas  the original format suits best for the more fun fights, such as Drunk Fights.

Aside from that, multiple judges = good but I agree with the masses that being sat down would be more comfortable for everyone involved. And maybe a tad bit less like it's a game show all around, but it might be an alright idea after we've had a couple Fights."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,I think the guys forgot Inception. Dom Cobb is one pf the most developed character in Movies. and then they question Chris Nolan's skills. And also go watch Memento and The Prestige.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"An Alien, Predator, Avatar universe would be sweet!"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,I liked the more relaxed format.  I also liked that with the three people there was more variety of points of view as well as feeling more friendly.  This just pits two people against each other instead of the more round table effect of the last format.  I'm glad they're continuing the program despite the past.  It's healthy to confront the bad and then move forward with the hope of making the future better.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Love having Movie Fights back. 
The only thing I will say is me personally think it's better if you guys are sitting down. Seems more like a fun talk that way not so much a debate.  And I would not rule out 3 fighters but it does not need to be in every show. That's just my 2 cents, but I love having the show back thank you all for the hard work you put in to it"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,I have to say I liked the old set up better
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,So great to see you guys back to hitting your stride.  Loved the episode and can't to have my Thursday routine back on track.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I feel bad for all fighters who have to stand for the whole fight. I think sitting around the table is more enjoyable for both the contestants and viewers. Also, the placement of the camera on the fact checker and social media people is off: it should be centered to have them both on the screen. I'm excited for the other changes though. Welcome back Movie Fights!"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Everyone's complaining about not having three fighters but the bigger change they need to make is not having two white dudes as the fighters each time.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Bring back the 3 fighters and the table. But keep the new scoring format
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"The new format is awkward, but I look forward to how you take this into the future. Love screen junkies. Glad you brought movie fights back . I hope we can see earlier guests again over time"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Now that I've seen Star Wars... I can SEE MOVIE FIGHTS!!! You guys made a great week even better!!
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Thor 3 was garbage
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Love seeing Hal being the host!
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,SOOO happy you all have brought back movie fights!! Is it going to be a podcast again in the future??? That’s how I always listened
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,I agree with Simon James. I liked 3 fighters and the sitting down format. It seemed more relaxed and personal.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Podiums are awkward. Hal needs a step stool. Prefer the sitting format. Need better lighting on the faces.But I did give you a thumbs up.Keep it less than an hour and you've got something.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"1) Bring back 3 fighters
2) I might in some fights have a good idea who is going to win going into the speed round because of how in the lead they are as well as the length of the video
3) Have the person who picked the answer first in the speed round go last. They should be rewarded with the ability to counter last."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Hal is a great host i like the look of the fight and think 2 fighters makes it feel like more of a fight, but there should be a separate show where like 4 people debate movies but in depth. Like what is the best star wars movie and just have 4 people go at it on just the one topic for half an hour or so"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Spencer lost only because he was not drinking anything
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I am not a fan of the public getting a vote.. may turn into a popularity contest! Also wouldn't mind there being 3 contestants again, but maybe 2 will work better :) (p.s, get Alicia as the host plz :D )"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,I hope you folks read comments.  The set doesn't reflect anything about the personality of the show.  It's boring and lifeless.  We're also missing something in the camera shots of the judges.  It feels cramped and slapped together.  Give 'em some space. You gotta get chairs and get back to 3 fighters.  2 fighters is too much like Schmoedown.  The chaos is part of the fun of the show and you've lost that.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I'm happy to see that your team didn't let Movie Fights go. It's smart to try a new format with new twists, to set yourself apart from the previous way of doing this, which is unfortunately tainted now. The sabotage round is a great idea. I've seen every fight, but don't remember that type of question. To me, it's new, and I love it. Hal did a great job, and I like how he threw fun questions in to each fighter. That's a great mediator. Still, though, 3 people is better. And sitting down felt more laid back, and, like someone said below, was like a group of friends hanging and debating fun topics. I'm with you whichever way you go, I just hope this isn't the set in stone way moving forward. Keep innovating, there's so much potential here"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,I do miss the three fighters. I am sure most do. Other than that I loved it. Great job guys!
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"What slightly annoys me is how the Hollywood Elite snubs comic book movies during awards time.  'Logan' makes me say this as I could see Jackman with a best actor nomination, Patrick Stewart with a best supporting actor nod, and also perhaps a writing and best screenplay nomination. If we thought that the Heath Ledger win was going to open the doors, well think again. Hollywood is stuck up."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Logan is an oscar worthy superhero movie since The Dark Knight (2008).

u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Mentioning the lost coin toss is a long time movie fights tradition

2.Spiderman HC 
3.Thor Ragnarok
4.Wonder Woman

I liked all of them loved two of them"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Don't know if I like point system, should, as always, be about the argument not on a voters bias opinion."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Wonder Woman is better than Logan but cool
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Hal makes a great judge yay! I do like three fighters, but I know there are fights where two work better. So maybe an occasional three man fight? Nice set though.

Will the new movie fights have a podcast feed like the old one?"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,The Ribbons across the bottom and left side of the screen are WAY to prominent. You should really reduce their size and prominence.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Welcome back!
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,I think there is a better solution then the coin toss for dealing with fighters having the same answer. The first fight is the perfect example of where it would have been better to state that Logan is the best and have the fighters fight for their second choice.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Love seeing this back! I love all of the changes made to the structure, especially the panel judging rather than one judge. I think that the lower third of the frame during the fight however has a ton of potential! Maybe you guys could put up tweets that have the hashtag or a youtube superchat? Tweets could work best as you guys could pick the tweets to display to make sure a fighter's argument doesn't get undercut by the audience or to prevent trolling. Keep up the great content guys love yah all!"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,I’ve missed Movie Fights! Welcome back!!
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I like some of these changes, but I'd much prefer three fighters."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Obviously you guys are taking the time to do this and still fixing things up and I respect that and thank you guys for it. But a suggestion, if we possibly could get the old way of movie fights would be really cool. I respect whatever decision you guys make though. thanks for bringing it back"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Logan was a great movie but they said Superhero movie. Logan was like 5% superhero, 95% drama. Ragnarok was 100% superhero, it's amazing. And I've watched Thor Ragnarok with people who'd never seen a marvel movie before and they had a blast."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Not a fan of this new format.... Too presidential debatesque. Set takes itself way to serious. Also please tell me Hal isn't regular host he is not suited to it....
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,I saw and was instantly pleased.  I do agree with what a lot of people are saying about enjoying having 3 fighters more.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Seeing a lot of people talking about the 3 fighters but Im also bothered that they aren't sitting. If I were one of the fighters I would get a stool cause I don't want to argue standing up for an hour.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Enjoyed all the super hero movies but

7. Thor 3
6. LEGO Batman
5. GOTG 2
4. Justice League 
3. Spider-Man Homecoming 
2. Wonder Woman
1. Logan"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,I'm gonna have to say Logan
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,bring back the old format. and seems like they have some new cameras and it reminded me of playing a game at 30 fps instead of 60fps not sure if anyone else noticed that as well.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,This was a great show. I love the new format!
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"A great way to start the new movie fights! Andy is watching this from home, wishing he wasn’t such a creep."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I am glad to see movie fights back, but I don't like this setup. Go back to three fighters ar and a table, it's more conversational"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Welcome back Movie Fights 
Nice new format.  I am interested to see more"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,I love the new format. It feels way more focused this way.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"While I agree that Logan is the better movie, I would have given the point to Spencer, mainly because when Hal asked specific questions about their movies, Spencer actually answer the questions while Dan just rebutted what Spencer said.

When Hal asked what makes a great super hero movie and how your movie fits into it, Spencer actually answered the question, Dan just talked about how Logan is different than Ragnarok"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,I'm okay with this new format
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"In round 1 Dan just sounds so pompous to push Thor aside cuz of comedy is stupid. I can't stand when Dan fights, he is always just talking like a film critic instead of a true fan. He always picks critically accepted films just to keep his credit. I thought half his wins were just bullshit and he needs to just not fight anymore keep him fact checking"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"To all the people getting worked up, THIS WAS THEIR TRIAL RUN! They will change it up, they wanted positive feedback. I don't mind the two fighters change, but they should have the option for high stools because the booths are tall as hell. Besides that The format is great and it's a fresh take on movie fights."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,I notice Spencer has true moments of greatness but then will fall back onto the argument of an internet troll. Dan's arguements are just on another level!
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,I kinda figured that spoiler from the trailers.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Love the new set. So glad I have my movie fights back to argue with my coworkers at AMC. Hal is perfect
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Fight starts at 5:45
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Which movie character is the worst back seat driver
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,I might be in the minority but I like this new format better. I have always thought their should be multiple judges. One person shouldn’t decide the winner
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I love to see Movie Fights back, but I pretty much agree with most all the comments. I love the casual friends feeling of the older format. 3 contestants, sitting around a table with a friendly debate. Also, I miss the length of the old shows, and the number of rounds feels INCREDIBLY small (especially after a 2 month hiatus, and a lot of great pieces of news to drop in that time span). 

Still, it's great to see the team and show back, and I wish you all the luck in your future productions."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Hal. Quit interrupting when Spencer is on a roll.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Is this Movie Fights of the Blade Runner universe?
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,I love Hal as the host
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Are these Blade Runner walls in the background? Nice touch.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,it's the first ep back guys...relax give them some time
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Hate the new format. Change it immediately !
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,....then imagine how checked out he will be an an animated movie (Dan Murrell 2017) - worth a like in anyone's book
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I  love the change to two fighters. This is a proper debate, a potential biased judge is ruled out with the rating system and a first to four format is great. All points matter. Hal asking questions to throw people off and really defend their picks is great.

I love it."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Dont have them stand the entire time i would hate that
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Honestly guys even before the incident, Movie Fights was getting a bit stale. This format is fantastic. I really love all the new crazy rounds and the judging. Maybe experiment with 3 fighters again at some point? But 2 fighters is very good as well. Great job guys love what you are doing."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,The old format is better
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I really like the production changes in the new format. I like the three judge system. I generally like Hal, but I'd REALLY like Roxy Striar to host this. The only change I'm not crazy about is switching to only two fighters. I much prefer having three fighters, both because it opens the fights up to more opinions and because I think the arguments are better when you have to defend against two different styles of arguments. 

Regardless, I'm very happy that movie fights is back and I can't wait to see what's coming in the new year."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Bring back the old format of movie fights, please?"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"this sucks, i prefer the way it used to be without andy of course"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Constructive criticism incoming: the 3 fighters were more interesting and watching them standing doesn’t work for me, I liked the 3 judges, some of the graphics and Hal as a host BUT watching on my tablet the sound was horrible. The contestants were too far from the mic and I could hear the sound of the room. Even the sync of the audio was bad. The show lost the casual feel it had which was more enjoyable. I started watching and got bored after a while. Everything felt so cold including the set which was great before... it looked so commercialized. Exactly the reason I don’t watch tv shows. Before I used to watch the whole episode every week. I understand that you are trying to change after everything that happened but this is not for me. I hope you change some things. There were a lot of things that made the show work for me and you missed a lot of them."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Please have 3 fighters....
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Will this be released on the podcast?
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,bring back the superhero toys! loved the show!
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Love the format guys. It's clear you put a lot of thought and effort in. 👍
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Eh, a lot more entertaining with 3 fighters"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,I would watch a predator/pirate movie.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,But will they be standing the whole time? give these people some chairs!
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I’ve never commented before but as an original viewer, I was really looking forward to movie fights coming back. I can only give my opinion, but I’m not a fan of the new layout, jumpy screen, Hal as the host, or just one on one fights. When you’re ready, please bring back 3-way fights, last man standing, and drunk fights."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Wonder Woman in my opinion, Logan a close second for me"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I am also a fan of the 3 fighter format over this, but I did really enjoy it! It took a few minutes for them to find their legs again, but I think they hit their stride. I don't mind what's happening, but I think it's a trial run. Looking forward to more innovations, keep it up guys!"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Please do 1080p
The rest is great."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Neither went with Wonder Woman... what???
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,13:15 This is my favorite argument Spencer has ever made. It's so much easier and lazy to just be serious all the time compared to being engaging and hilarious.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Keep Hal as a judge, bring back everything else. Where's the hammer, and the bell, and the arena-style introduction and POV? There is no feeling in this anymore... we need to feel like a fight, like a raw matching of wits and grit. 3 or more fighters, not less! we are not children nor ADHD victims, we can hadle more then an hour of show. stand down, let the people relax so that they can engage the deeper meanings, not politicize standing up like assholes (we got that part covered already). Also, you brought the whole team today to show support and that you are united, and that's fine but pleeeease, lose everyone but the judge and the fact checker (he can manage the polls also), cause in this case I don't care about Screen Junkies, I care about the fighters. And stop beeing so PC! please let the swear words fly and the fight get dirty cause entertainment should have no care for that!"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Spencer, vacate the belt and lets have a tournament for the new title in 2018!"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I don't think I like this new setup. Are the guys going to stand for the whole game? This show used to be chill! But now it looks like a cheap, cold TV quiz show. Also, is it limited to two people now? And where are the sound effects, like the bell and the fake audience? Also not sure about Hal as a judge...
That being said, I really like the new graphics on the side."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Really glad your back loveed the fight but so missed the 3 person fight the speed round was never the fun part of movie fights the main rounds were and the comedy answers when one fighter just took it totally differently please change it back to 3
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Hey, Love to see you guys again. I have to say I liked the more casual 3 fighters sitting down together than this new two fighters standing up format. I am also not a fan of the new judging score, where the host is not the judge. Would prefer if Hal had the casting vote. Other than that OWSOME!"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Really digging the set! I like the visuals of this new set such as the left bar, the title heads, new logo, etc. I love that you guys are cutting down on the amount of questions (3 rounds as opposed to 5). And I love that you now have more than one judge!! So much better than putting it all on one individual.

I 100% agree with everyone else that I’ do not like the standing podiums. I think they would be great to pull out during a championship match but I miss the informality of a bunch of “geeks” sitting at a table together. It felt more relaxed and more inviting as a viewer. I do feel like the banter is so much better with three fighters and it is great seeing three different perspectives.

It may take time in order for things to fall back into place the way that works best for you guys- So glad to see Movie Fights back!"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Either make it shorter (2 rounds, 3 speed rounds) or bring back 3 fighters.
Hal is a great judge!
More than one judge is superior.
Keep up the good work!"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Wonder woman,  hands down."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I like the permanent graphics and I think the 2 person format will work better in the long run. I didn't like when the show turned into a shouting match.

I would suggest to add some background music and I miss the toys."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I really like the new questions mid fight.
And also the set is nice, but get the fighters some stools to sit on :P"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I think if you want to use a comedy as your standard for greatness, you gotta go The Good Place: innovative, creativy, hilarious, and high stakes that pay off in service of characters, while moving and pushing plot and jokes forward.

Does Thor Raganrok achieve this? Yes, to a degree, but it falls short in the character front, with some more pushing it would have been an absolutely revolutionary superhero comedy, but it settled for being a good comedy, and while that is ok, if it doesn't achieve comedy greatness and as such it can't match the great dramatic stakes and emotional resonance of Logan. But they could have competed if they pushed a bit harder on a revolutionary comedy"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Anybody else think Dan was rather pissed off in this episode?
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,my pick on the Backwards round was Admiral General Aladeen from The Dictator so pretty lucky for me that I didn't have to fight that round
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Like the new set but you need to bring back the 3 fighters format and also increase the lighting on set
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,I love that you guys are bringing it back but I agree we should go back to 3 fighters for variety. and I don't really care for the high school debate podiums  haha. Still watching though
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Glad to see you guys finally bringing this back and making some changes.  Here are some of my thoughts on them:
- The new set is a bit bland.  I liked that you changed it up, and I like the podiums... Just maybe add some more movie-related decos in the background?  Or maybe, over time as rivalries rise, some ""boxing style"" pictures of previous matchups?
- You got those nice monitors on the front of the podiums, why not put the contestant's score on it?  That way you wouldn't have to keep repeating it.
- I like the 3 judges approach.  Much more fair than before.
- I miss having 3 contestants.  I love the beautiful chaos that would ensue when all 3 were arguing at once.  I feel like it's not really a fight with 2.  Just a debate.
- Great choice of fighters for the re-opening of this show.
- Maybe just a personal thing, but I'd prefer less questions like ""What's the best/worst whatever movie of whatever timeframe?"" and more open-ended/silly questions, because they usually result in much more creativity and humor, which are the reasons I like to watch movie fights."

u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Best Movie out of super hero movies is Logan but Best Superhero Movie is Thor  Rag. Huge difference
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Logan. Plain an simple.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Alicia gets the point!
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Finally they don't have the dodgy judging move of automatically DQ'ing a contestant because they gave a fair compliment to a movie their fighting against
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I really like the new format. More judges is great. Only 2 fighters is perfect (less chance of people shouting over each other). The graphics on screen help a lot.

The only think I would change is the set. It doesn't look as cosy as the old one and the fighters look uncomfortable standing up the entire time."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Get chairs and make it less stiff
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Glad you are back! Bring back 3 fighters:)
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Voice guy please say ""(spitting noise) salt"""
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Glad Movie Fights is back but the back and foreground needs movie memorabilia, e.g. posters, props, action figures etc."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I don't like the new set. It looks cheap, dull and unprofessional. Bring back the movie posters, toys and the table. I also prefer the 3 fighter format."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Dan is on fire
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"This comment will probably be lost forever, but still. Standing the entire fight must be tiring, I would get some chairs. And social media reactions are cool, but don't read them during the speed round. Sloooows it down terribly. When the fight is like 20 min, okay, you read random stuff for a few minutes. But if the fight is like 2 minutes, limit it to 1 or 2 social media reactions."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Guys, this is my two cents. Hal as judge, best thing ever! But the rest... a little underwhelming. Fighters need to stand the whole way through? The set would be OK, but I think I speak on behalf of most of us MF fans when I say, we need the table. Also, having only two fighters makes it a lot more confrontational than it used to be, which is what you said you wanted to avoid. Three fighters make the whole fight much more conversational and informal, with only the last part, the speed round, the culmination of the fight, where it gets a little more raw. Rather than two fighters, I would even like to see four fighters. The ""best of 7"" also limits the show a lot. I understand that maybe you couldn't keep the old format due to legal reasons, but this new format leaves a lot to be desired. Experiment more with it, please. I don't make this comment just to hate the new. I know some changes had to be made. I write it because I love Movie Fights, and I waited patiently for it to come back, and I feel us, the fans, can help you get it to an even higher level than it used to be, through our criticism. I know a lot of work is ahead of you, and behind you, and maybe you cannot focus on everything at once, so we will be patient. All the best for the Screen Junkies!"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I'm sorry but this feels like Movie Debate; not Movie Fights. Not only is it missing the frenetic energy of the 3 player system, making this less entertaining than before, it just feels too cold and formal. Doesn't change the fact that I'll still gladly watch every week."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I was really hoping for some new and different questions, less superheroes."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Glad your back. Enjoyed the fight. Great work all. 

I like the multiple judges. I'll never vote live as I always watch at a later point but having several either.

The set I don't mind, but I think I preferred the round table style more than the podiums.

I prefer the longer format questions as the fighters can use more arguments to back up there case. So I think I preferred the 5 long questions with a speed round for the top two.

 Which leads me on to my largest comment that having only 2 fighters is in my opinion not as entertaining as the previous format, no where near.

The third fighter would give a further counterpoint that would keep the arguments more fluid. Allowing for a shift. Where as with 2 there seemed to be more of a. ""That's not how I see it"" arguments, which you did get with a 3 person fight but I think it seemed more prominent.

But as I said. Good work all and glad your back fighting."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,rudnick is not smooth enough..... his delivery is a little stunted and its quite distracting
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,bring back the 3 fighters format back please.. love you guys..
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Justice league?
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,The title fights will not feel special if it’s 1v1 all the time.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,ITS BACK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Nice show guys. I would echo what people have said and advocate 3 fighters and sitting round a table but will support the show and channel whatever you decide to do
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Love hearing Joe Starr laughing in the background
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"SO incredibly happy to get Movie Fights back :)
The episode was pretty decent, but the 3 fighter format was better, and the set needs life and decor.
...and some background music or something. It feel a little too dead-air.
Love you guys. Thanks for bringing my favorite web show back.  <3"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,3 ways was more fun
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"They can do what they like with the format, the fights are still interesting...but please let the fighters have chairs. I'm worried that standing for that long will not be comfortable for them :("
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Love the new backwards/sabotage questions you guys!
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Thor seemed like Guardians of the Galaxy
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Set design is horrible. The background behind Hal is distracting and awful. Lightning is nonexistent. Please take care of this, it is painful to watch. Apart from that, welcome back to fighting!"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Welcome back Movie Fights. Seems like the show's gonna be fine :3
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Please bring back the old format! 3 fighters and the old set. This set is so boring and cold. Really, who thought this was a good idea."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,That new set is horrific. So cold and bland and cheap. It’s looks so formal and stiff. Couldn’t they afford seats?? Much prefer 3 fighters too. A big NO from me. Hope they make changes or I won’t be watching. No atmosphere and feels so unfriendly!!
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Great to see Movie Fights back. The changes will take time to get used to, but my first impressions are: Like the new montage, Hal did great, 3 judges is a good idea but the 3rd should NOT be the online vote, it felt formal maybe contestants should be sitting, 2 contestants is okay if both are equally good and popular fighters but if only one of them is boring (like some have been in the past) the episode will lose steam quickly. Looking forward to the next episodes."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,I had sub ur video subscribe my video too
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Bring back mike Carlson!
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"The whole point was ""friends arguing about movies"" it's not a game show"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Great to finally see the movie fights back! Not really feeling the new ”old game show” style as I preferred the old style with 3 fighters sitting around the table but eh, maybe this’ll grow on me. Just have to wait & see"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,WE MISS TGE TOYSSS
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"This new set is so bland, colorless, and boring. Bring the 3 person fights back!!"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Like the new structure. Not a fan of the set. It looks cold and seems uncomfortable to them. Kinda preferred it when they were siting down.  THAT BEING SAID, i LOVE the fact that Hal is hosting and the new way of voting. So happy this is back!!!!"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Nice to have a movie fights episode where the only Predator was the one in Dan's pitch for a Fox/Disney franchise crossover!
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Do glad to see the movie fights return.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Ridiculous questions which lead to forced comedy. Guys, you can do better. Let fighters argue and don't interfere so much."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Welp, I guess back to Schmoedown it is."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I'm very happy with the come back of a beloved show, and I was thoroughly anticipating it. The new format seems less biased given its one on one and the new voting system seems well rounded already. 

Now to make it more of a positive criticism, the set is way too PC and lost some of its geek appeal. A bit of geek culture would go a long way to build up an atmosphere without leaning too much on the old."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,I like this new way but prefer if they were sitting  down instead standing. With the option there for a 3rd person to as well. But otherwise I loved it missed it so much
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,I too want 3 fighters and if they want it? The option to sit should be there cuz I imagine it has to get tiresome after an hour
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Love the new set! Reminds me of Jeremys movie game show on plus, which was my favorite format. good job guys!"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I  honestly think Logan is one of the most overrated movies of the year. I enjoyed it well enough, but it's getting so much credit it doesn't deserve. It wasn't ground breaking just because it nicked tropes from other genres. The whole 'Logan fights a shady organisation who are mistreating kids and using altered clones of him and he fights to free the kids' is Wolverine Origins again but not terrible."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"11:09 Asgard build on blood? i didn't see any blood in the all damn movie, Hella impaled a army and their was no blood or wounds, even the eye gouging was illogical, the way Thor was hit it should have left a big scar on his forehead too."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Really missed movie fights. Great new format and amazin fight.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,this is great! Movie fights is back! YAY
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,I dont think dan feels comfortable standing this long
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"i prefer the table setup, it allows more people and standing up 1h without moving doesn't look comfortable."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Yeah Dan ... Great Pirates/Predator pitch
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"This new style makes me nervous, reminds me too much of my high school debating days"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Also, production nerdy question, are you guys intentionally using a lower frame rate for movie fights? Seems weird compared to your other shows"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Glad to see you back but not a fan of the new set up, the old one was a lot more fun I felt. Yes I hate change."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,I'm so excited movie fights is back! But I do miss the old set
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,I mean Im really glad that Movie Fights is back but I agree with the fact that there needs to be three people. I hope that they work on it and adapt it to be what the fans want
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Great choice of having Hal replace he who shall not be named. Set is modern I dig it. Format is gonna take some getting used to.. I really enjoyed the 3 fighter format.. we shall see. Overall super happy to have this back. Is the fan seat still available? I was def in line to be in that before the hiatus lol.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Very well done! New format feels fair with the right results, brilliant stuff!"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,I'm all for you guys changing things to make it feel fresh and different from the tainted memories of the old format... but please get some stools or something.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I have to disagree with all the people in the comments saying they prefer the 3-person fights. Those worked when the show was in its infancy and everybody was more interested in having a discussion than in winning, but since the show has evolved into heated debates, one-on-one works a lot better. I enjoyed this a lot more than the more recent pre-Andy-drama episodes as a result of that.

However, I do agree that the set could be more colorful, and I also think the border/overlay takes up too much of the screen. Turns out I'm a lot less invested when the fighters don't fill the whole viewing space, and I feel like the information on the border isn't worth the trade-off.

In spite of those things, I'm really glad Movie Fights is back and I can't wait to see where it goes!"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I know its not possible, but...can you please bring back the old format?"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Great to have movie fights back and I can tell you have worked hard on this new format. 
But this just does not feel right and felt more stale. The whole debate set felt so serious and not the chill laidback style like before.
Also as many other commented, three fighters is the way to go.
Love you guys and hope you take our voices into account!"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,I'm glad the show is back but I'm with the most of the comment section I prefer the table and 3 person fights
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I'll agree with many of the comments about the 3 fighter format, it made for more fun debates, plus more room for new fighters.

I like the judging set. Makes for more interesting reasoning as to why someone gets a vote. Also by making the viewer vote a link you ensure that people are probably listening to the arguments before they vote, maybe only make it votable from a certain point in the fight, like only after 5 minutes?

Hal is a great host, That's probably my favorite part of this format, Hal asked interesting questions in the objective opinion rounds and fun questions in the silly rounds, he's fun and funny. Love the whole ""host"" idea

Sabotage is a great mechanic but it shouldn't be in speed round, what would have made that debate really fun is if we'd see them do their all to convince us that those are James Francos best movies. Because they only had the speed round amount it came down to which is not that bad

I can't tell you how happy I am that movie fights are back."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I like the new graphics, and may I just say, let's give this new set some time. I get that first impressions matter, but I think we should give it a chance. Yes, I liked the old one too, maybe even better, but you know what, every now and then you have to bring a new ideas to shows and then accordingly, things like sets and maybe certain rules here and there change too. I guess we as fans and viewers often really like the familiar, because it's comforting, but the show and the whole team had to move forward. After all, it's the people that fight and bring interesting arguments and their knowledge to this show; it's about the debate and taking movies both critically and humorously. I really enjoyed seeing Spencer and Dan fight and thank you for bringing Movie Fights back.
Now, the issue that I personally have (and I get that this is just a sneak peek), is that the same people circle around all the shows at screen junkies, and no offense to anyone, nor the people who make SJ neither the fans. I get that these are the people who basically are SJ; I like seeing Roth, Dan and Spencer on SJU and I watch them every day, but I'm just not sure it works (only FOR ME, PERSONALLY), because conceptually all the shows or specials differ, at least a bit."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I am glad you are back, but I really do prefer to have 3 people debating in the opening round. The pacing seemed better."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,I'll be honest I used to find Hal kind of annoying but he's actually a really good host on this.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"SO HAPPY, to have Movie Fights back and Dan (and Spencer) back in the ring. Hal - well done on the judging, you were very entertaining and fair. 

I really appreciate you tried to improve things and polish them up. Unfortunately I think having 3 fighters made the whole thing more wild and unpredictable - and thus more fun to watch, it was more of a brawl rather than a 1vs1 match. It's Movie Fights rather than Movie Duels after all, if you like.

I am fine with the set I guess, it's a bit sterile as people have said before (nothing from with some personality injection) though I understand why you would want to firm up the branding etc.

Hope you might bring back the three way fights at least occasionally... Thanks and all the best.


P.S. Ragnarok > Logan NO contest!"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Oh no that doesn't look good.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I do like three judges, but I don't think the poll should get a vote, do to people mainly chooses based on their opinion not argument. Please go back to three fighters it just brings more content. Dan or Spencer as host/judge, the other as fact checker/judge, and Hal or Roth as pole taker/judge/comment reader. This set is terrible it feels like you game showed this. I enjoy the old set it felt like we were hanging out and cool movie stuff was everywhere. If I wanted a game show I would just go watch one."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,I really apreciate all the changes but i really miss the table. I dont know why but it made look the show and the contesters closer to the public.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Keep this format but have 3 fighters it feels more snappy and sharp
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Great to see this back, I even like the new set but letting people vote on the winner is a bad idea. Get ready for everyone to vote for their favourite fighter or film choice and ignore the arguments."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I'm glad it's back, but i'm not liking the new format.  3 people debating was more fun and it is movie FIGHTS, not Reasonable Movie Discussion Hour."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Dan clearly hasn't seen Antonio Banderas in the latest Spongebob movie.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I too loved the casualness and carefree style of the old movie fights, its what made the show great. I agree with alot of people here the older way was better."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Roth does not like Dan
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"You don't need the graphics all the time up on the screen. And this setup is way too serious. The table is an open space, a conversation space. You are not debating who wants to be elected. Hell, you can keep the 2 fighters format, but at least sit down! But anyway, thank you for coming back!"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I am so happy this show is back, it feels evil to complain about anything. I'm going to complain now because this seems like the beta version so it's ok? I'm not crazy about the new set, it feels claustrophobic. I miss that desk with all the action figures and stuff; needs more props. And chairs. Comfortable chairs!!! 

Everything else, I like. I like the new format, I like Fawn McClane, and as always Dan and Spen are really good at this, especially that first round.

I don't think you needed to apologize for over the top negativity though, I really didn't get a sense of that before. It was nice to see that kind of drama and passion. Anyway, good stuff."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,I never like the speed rounds much so them being so heavily weighted irks me. I would rather see them just disappear plus they always trip up the guest combatants. I mean I don't mind them having to come up with an title or actor on the spot but I'd rather see the actually fight without the arbitrary time limit. The head to head combat is neat and will probably help the talk loudly so I win problem of old. The Judging isn't bad but I would go to the peoples vote last in the reveal. That way I could hear 2 explainations/view of why someone made a stronger argument after each segment.  I would change up the set behind the host it is kind of a big empty void of dark color.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,So glad that this is back 🖤
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I really like the 3 judges concept. I don't know that I agree with having the fans be a judge though. 
We're far more likely to be biased or not even really watching it"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"It seems like this head-to-head format is only gonna work when there are two formidable opponents.  It's going to become a much tougher watch, the deeper they go into their fighter roster.  Please go back to 3 person fights. As far as the new judge: keep the tryouts going."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Yeaaaaah ... Nice to have you back guys
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Is that wall pattern the same one from Deckard’s apartment in Bladerunner?
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I don't like how the poll gives a point. Most people just vote for the film they like/the film they've seen, so as Dan has pointed out it's usually the newest film that wins. I've also never liked the speed round and prefer the long debate questions so don't like how there are just three. But great work bringing movie fights back!"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,3 fighters
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I like it. Hal makes a great host, as will Roth and others when the opportunity presents itself. The structure is a welcome addition. Three votes coming from where they do, 's'good. I imagine three participants will return when this new system is comfortable and familiar enough to invite others in. Though, I would hope that invitations will be mindful of the participants behaviour as the previous incarnation of the game often fell into disrespectfully talking over each other, which also made the audio quality of a debate a debacle, irritatingly so. If the previous offenders can't manage to play respectfully I trust fresh faces can be found."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"1) Logan
2) Thor Ragnarok
3) Wonder woman / Spiderman homecoming (both are equally good)
4) Guardians of the galaxy 2
5) Justice league

Logan was a masterpiece , this list is just my opinion"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Logan is the best Super hero move of the year.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,I hope the next fight has 3 fighters
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Please bring a third fighter back!
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Bring back the old format
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,LOGAN for SUuuuuRE!
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"reading through the comments it seems the vast majority of people prefer 3 people and sitting down, it felt more relaxed and fun before, this all looks a little too serious standing behind podiums"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,the one hour mark is the best improvement
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Great fight, but it only worked cuz Dan and Spencer are so good. Would prefer the old way with 3 fighters (or more) sitting around a table"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,I liked all the cool little things on the table and the relaxed format.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Predator of the carrabean is gonna be rated ARRRRR!!
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,this is weird
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,I think the production is just needing more sound cues. Really missed the bell at the start of each round. Could be done with also small sound clips or samples.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,I love to hear Dan argue. Smart intelligent and entertaining
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Dan killed it on Logan.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Wow! new movie fights is awsome!
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I love the two fighter-format but I do agree with some of the criticisms I read in the comments (them not sitting, standing so far apart of etc). Looking forward to more movie fights next year!"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"""let them fight"" has to be in the montage"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Personally I love the new 1 on 1 format. With 3 it always felt like a bit of a mess.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Logan is not ashamed of being a superhero film. It deconstructs comic book movie tropes but in the end, it reaffirms the importance of comic book films. Laura is literally saved by her faith in comic books."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I'm so excited it's back! I loved it, loved all of it. I'm 100% on board if Hal is the judge most of the time. I really liked his leading questions during rounds instead of all freeform. I was fine with the set, made me think of 80's a bit. Laughed a bunch. I would have liked to have known Hal's vote per round, even if it didn't count. So great you guys, I'll watch every week. I think the zootopia/die hard cross over is something they should seriously do. 

I also miss TV fights, and the friday skits. Maybe you guys could bring back skits you make up sometimes, on some other show? Joe and his didgeridoo was the best."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"have the people sitting, doesn't have to be at the same table, and make the background less busy, more dark, solid."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"stop saying the word ""fun"" every other word"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Logan deserves the win but I would have definitely picked Spider-Man over Thor. Completely down to earth and expresses petes trials as a high schooler trying to grow up and figure out his responsibility and fit in New York and the world in the most Spider-Man way. Maybe not spidey 2 level of what Spider-Man means to New York but definitely the most spider man spider man we have ever had imo
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Why do the cameras on the fighters look like they shoot with potato quality?
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Didn't think this would be an unpopular opinion. But this format is WAY better.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Andy was never good at moderating, but Hal doesnt seem much more confident. Also with no ambient noise or music it is way too quiet"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Loved the montage!
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,I DONT LIKE CHANGE. (tbh this will sure be great)
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Logan is a fucking masterpiece...can't believe how good it was
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,So great to have This show back 😊 and i really like that there is more then 1 judge!!!! 😊
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,As much as I am happy that u guys are back I liked the 3 player sit down set up better....maybe y'all can bring it back for special eps.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Hal hosting = great
3 judges = nice. Better than just one
2 fighters = nah. I prefer 3 At least.
Fighters standing = seems uncomfortable. I prefer they sitting."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,I hate hal :/ Sorry
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Please do Mr.Robot Honest Trailer next
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"So glad it's back! The only thing that bothered me was the onscreen graphics, don't get me wrong, I've always wanted a point meter and round indicator, but I feel you can fit that all into a lower third bar without having to reduce the screen size. A lot of wasted space in the graphics. Other than that, fantastic job! Love the Ebert approach."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Warmest welcome home guys! Not a fan of the game show format, but way to take it back!!"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Dont like the new setup. Miss the bell, table with bunch if crap on it, miss the fun. It feels way to formal here."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,this studio makes it impossible to bring in fan art :(
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Gotta bring the ring bell back
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I miss the three persons fight, with only two there is less points of view and discussion, also the speed round losses impact, because all the fight was only two people."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Logan is the better movie, but Spencer got robbed in round 1. He had more passion and better arguments, and ultimately the question was the best superhero movie, not the best movie, and Thor Ragnarok does a better job of embodying the best that a superhero movie can be and Spencer did a great job of pointing out some of those characteristics. Superhero movies are supposed to be a fun escape from reality, not a gritty and depressing slog through reality. That is not to say that Logan is bad, it's just not a great superhero movie - it's a great movie set in a superhero world."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,We need 3 fighters and also drunk fights
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Was better with the 3 people doing the fights, the random craziness made it so much fun to watch."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Welcome back guys. It's good to see you.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,the montage was sick !!!
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Moviefights is back and I'm happy that it is. screenjunkies rocks!
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Spencer makes Goldblum impressions sometimes. Unintentionally.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Personally; I like the old format and set more. This seems way too polished and formatted; where the old movie fights was a bit more relatable and free flowing. I liked movie fights not only because it was a good show, but because it wasn't over produced and was a bit more casual. Now I feel like I'm watching a weird cluster-fuck of Jeopardy and movie reviews. Don't get me wrong; I'm still going to watch this new version of movie fights, but I hope they can eventually capture the same magic as the old show."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Alright, this needs 3 people fighting."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,The 3 fighter format was the best. It allowed for a more comfortable atmosphere and more crazy and fun ideas. This is just a boring debate and not really a full on brawl like the old movie fights was
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I like the new format but I do miss the 3 people fights. Also bring back the old makeshift movie posters that fans gave you guys, like the made up pacino fake movie."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Let the contestants sit, damn it."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Wonder Woman...
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Dangerous Dan back on top
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,finally another movie fights.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,I watch on my iPad and I don't like the overlay. The list of questions on the side makes my view of the fighters even smaller. Show it at the start of each question the remove it.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"1. Logan
2. Thor Ragnarok
3. Wonder woman
4. Justice league
5. GOTG 2"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Now you've changed the format to a 1v1 fight please can you get Chris Stuckmann and Jeremy Jahns to fight it out. I'd also love to see Chris Stuckmann battle it out with Mark Kermode. Having Kermode there would bring a really interesting dynamic to the show
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Spoiler: either way Marvel Wins
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,I'm so happy Movie Fights came back! :)
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Best Superhero movie in 2017 and the 21st century in general is WonderWoman and everything else didn't even come close in my opinion :-)
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Finally
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Logan is overrated
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,I don't like that light blue ... nah you're alright it's fine but bring back 3 fighters. Also how often did the twitter poll ever agree with the judges in the previous format? Using it now seems like a way to get more clicks vs any kind of meaningful assistance.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I want it to go back to having 3 people competing, but I'm okay with the other changes !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Logan, not even a contest"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Can't wait for someone to accidentally say ""this is tough"" followed by an awkward moment where everyone just looks at each other in silence."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"3 Fighters, my dudes."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,i am happy to see movie fights back but the set looks old and fighters look far. and i liked the three fighter format. make this set brighter like sju
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Wow, was this a BAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAD idea."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,He can do a good fish 😂
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I like the new manner of movie fights but only with the right host. So Hal has to stay, or give Spencer a few beers and throw him behind the podium."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,I really loved this!
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,I really like the old set...felt more personal and comfortable
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,I missed this
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Love the new format of having the point go to a consensus winner. Only thing I hope you guys reconsider is having a third fighter, not that Spencer and Dan didn't kill it, but having that third fighter just makes things more intense I feel. Plus that third fighter format helped me discover my love with Max Landis, so there's that.

Glad to have Movie Fights back."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"As unique as 3 people was, I do like how this all feels a bit more structured and organised. 
I think I preferred 3 people but the difference is negligible :)"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,I like 3 people on the stage better.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,I like 3 people on the stage better.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I liked it when there were three or even four giving their answer and arguments better than just the two. I also liked it better when they wre sittign at the table. this seems more causal and intimate and like I""m more part of the discussion rather than watching people making a speech. 
Please bring back three people and the jusdge and sit them at a table."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,It's good to see you guys back.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Loving the new format! So glad Movie Fights is back!
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,'Shane. One of the best films of the era....'    ummmm no....
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Locve the new montage, new format is interesting, but i am not sure about the standing setting, becomes less of a conversation"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,This is too sterile and gameshow-y. Bring back 3-4 people and a host sitting around a table with the toys behind them.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,#letthemsit #bringinathirdfighter but I like the other changes tbh
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"New Movie Fights, New Belt!! FIGHT!"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I enjoyed this show for the most part. Hal makes a great host and what a great pick to host this show. I do miss the old format of three fighters and sitting down. It feels very formal this new format and one of the reasons why I liked this show so much was because it felt like a group of friends gathered together to discuss and debate movies.This felt more like a debate but I know you guys are going to improve upon this new format and I look forward to the future of this show,"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Logan is the best CB Movie of 2017.

u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Does anyone else love Roth as timekeeper in the speed rounds? Her timing was spot on but what really caught me was how fair she was with the time. If someone went over a second or two she'd make it even every time. 10/10
I also didn't realize how badly I missed watching Dan debate about movies - the man is a film savant."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Ummm Boba Fett vs predator? Has this been said?
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,My first thought after watching was that I miss 3 fighters. Then I read the comments and a lot of people are saying the same thing. I would support pulling a third person in - it just adds an extra dynamic and further interest and dimension to have 3 points of view. The free flow arguments of previous movie fights were missing a bit here - Hal added extra questions half way through the fights which I think just took away from the discussion rather than added anything. But love that movie fights is back... and obviously trying new things is good. I'm sure they'll be tweaking as they move forward.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Great job guys, loving this and the changes in every single possible way"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"This reminds of a news broadcast. Or a political debate... Not to mention I prefer having 3 people compared to 2. I guess what I'm trying to say is that this feels too formal. It looked and felt more laid back before, which is what I liked about it."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"The great thing about this is we don't have Andy shoving it down our throats how excited we should be and how great everything is or is going to get in his fake hype voice. Sorry, I'm sure he was good at his job behind the scenes, minus the creepy stuff...but I couldn't stand him anyway. 

I LOVE the all the updates and new voting and the scoreboard and I love the start fresh plan for 2018. I will agree that 3 fighters is more interesting to watch but I'll watch regardless because movie fights rocks (also tv fights #bringthatbacktoo). <3"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Blade runner tiles on the wall. Pretty nice
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Really gotta bring back the old format imo. This wasn't *bad*, but the three person fight is so much better. Also, the standing at podiums seems awkward for movie fights."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Wonder Woman is a good movie, but very interchangeable with Cap: The First Avenger, but in TFA, the villain was developed throughout the movie. Gal Gadot is good, but at times monotone. I'm not trying to take away anything but it had some holes"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I think for the movie fights title you should vacate it, and then have like a tournament, 4, 8, 16 whatever"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Spencer should not have won the 2nd round, because Dan's answer was 100 BETTER !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Love that movie fights is bad, but it really does need 3 fighters. It's far more dynamic and interesting that way. Two can team up and bag on one opponent, it makes ""joke"" answers more viable.  Adds more hijinks and fun. The three fighter format is definitely the way to go. Reading the comments most people seem to agree, so just keep it as it is, and add another stand. Anyways, glad movie fights is back!"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,I enjoyed Logan more but Spencer missed some major major pts
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"The pirate wouldn't have some monologue to the Predator despite teaming up, just like at the end of AvP where Sanaa Lathan and the impregnated Predator kill the Queen"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,I think you should bring back three people simply so we can have more points of view and discussions. Also...standing is weird. It feels more like a debate rather than a discussion/fight. Just my two cents.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Best: Logan.
Worst: Guardians of The Galaxy Vol 2. (Torture).
Special Mention: Justice League."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,31:20 the first AvP was PG-13
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Zootopia and Die Hard sounds fuckin amazing
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"FLICKBAIT next plz, pretty please!"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Ya, I think the main issue is that they were using colder, bluer lights and there is a lot of metal used in the construction of the set."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,OH SHIT IT'S BACK but the greenscreen studio looks super lame... and not sure if I like the 1v1 format
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"George Washington said ""dying is easy, living is hard"". US history taught you this, or probably a 30 second Google search."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"What I like, the three judge rule. What I don't like, everything else. Lol. Please bring back the three fighter format and a more casual seeing. And great to have it back!!"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I can't stand Hal as a host, the new format is dull and the set is uninviting.  Go back to the original format.  Also, turn the fan down it's picking up real bad in the audio."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Glad you're back guy's !!!!the new format is cool altough the old one was nice too... the only weird thing for me is that you are standing hahaha
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I love it guys!!! I like the new judging set up! But I miss 3 opponents, and I like th judge pushing the debate along but maybe not so specific as to push anyone into a corner, just a suggestion from my personal point of view, not to sound whiny. I love it, and I'm glad movie fights is back! Thanks guys."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Movie fights now with less sexual harassment!
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Love the new format!!! I agree with many other people, let these boys sit!! Lol The new format is great and brings structure, but I miss the casual feel. Otherwise great comeback, super excited for next year!"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Both are great. I honestly don’t want to watch Logan again, though I liked it. But Thor was just fun. And I can watch fun movies over and over again."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,I think that this was awesome and I'm so glad to have it back
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I'm always for change and I want to see this fighting style for a couple more weeks, but I just feel that the third fighter brought another perspective that was interesting."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,welcome back you guys!! excited for this refresh ❤️❤️❤️
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,hmmm well I'm glad it's back I can't say I'm a fan of the most the changes. I preferred 3 people just chilling around a table arguing. I do enjoy having 3 judges with the audience being a tie breaker. I understand that might not work with more then two people but still.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Thought this was about the actual fights in movies 😂
Anyway Thor Ragnarok was a quality film Marvel never disappoints"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,I dunno if anyone at screenjunkies reads these comments but I'd like to echo everyone else's complaints and just say the new format feels so much more sterile and lacks the energy that made movie fights so fun to watch.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Love the new question and judge format. The screen visuals and montage are lovely.
Miss the dynamic of three fighters and the homey feeling of the old set.
Hal would be better suited for specific fighters, as his attempts to get Dan to improve were... ineffective, and that is understandable but also sad.

Excited to see where it goes from here."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,I love this format. I honestly think I might actually start watching Movie Fights now.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"3 fighters and organized free for all feels more like a ""fight"""
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Kinda wish that Hal was judging and hosting, like the 1v1 style though. Still would miss the old one too, maybe switch off every one else and a while?"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"You can't ask movie nerds to stand for an hour, get some bean bags. Don't make the polls matter the audience just picks whatever comic movie they recognize"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Love the new voting feature as well as the new graphics! However, not a big fan of having everyone standing. Would instead suggest having everyone sit but still keep the same format (each contestant on either side of the judge). Would also be cool if you guys created a ranking system similar to like ELO or even just a generic power ranking system."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"yes please 3 people 
we dont mind the old format"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,I don't like change
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,say: 'trimberly'
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,This was one of the best. Great job. I look forward to the next.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,As a fan of the comic 'Old Man Logan' the movie Logan was absolute shit.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"How did neither of them pick Wonder Woman or Lego Batman, also I really want Spiderman meets X-23"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,I think Logan is overrated. My favorite superhero movie of 2017 is Spider-Man: Homecoming.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Aw, it's so good to have you guys back!! I'll miss the old format, but I completely understand why you had to revamp. I'm so excited to see what you guys do with the show. And I LOVE Hal as host!"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"i know that Screenjunkies wanna try and move on and i don't blame them. But this was just borring as hell. The new format looks REALLY bad from the intro montage, to the set to the sidebar, and why only have 2 fighters?  When there were 3 there were such a great dynamic this way it's just meh"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,I have to say the 3 fighter cut to 2 was way better. Hal seems to lead the fighters way too much. Three way fights are more primal.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Was waiting for this for a while! But bring back the three format please!
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,This feels like high school or campaign style debate. The fun really did come from 3 fighters. You guys should throw the new background out.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,too bad backwards fight no one said The Dude.  perfect Jedi
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Everybody seemed real nervous to start off, which is understandable seeing as how Hal isn't used to hosting this and Roth and Danielle never were on the coach before (I think).  Got better when the fight started but I do miss the chill setting of everyone sitting at the desk.  Three fighters would be cool too, hope u bring that back.  I'll get used to the new set.  Just happy to have this back.  Great job."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I have loved Movie Fights since the very first episode. I understand the desire to reinvent the format, but these changes were not for the better. While, I like the idea of multiple judges, I don’t like the new set, the two fighter format, and having the fighters stand. I miss the feeling of a bunch of friends sitting around a table having the same geeky movie debates we’ve all had ourselves. Plus, how are you going to do drunk Movie Fights with people having to stand?"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I was anxious right up till the poop jokes, then just had a sense of ...it's back<3"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,YAY! Movie Fights! <3 NOO Hal is the host :(
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Sorry, but Ragnarok doesn't  even hold a candle to Logan"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"It seems like whoever goes second in the speed round has a big advantage.  They get more time to think about their answer while the other person is talking, they get to respond to whatever the other person said, and they get the last word.  Perhaps the first person to answer should get to go second?"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I want Hal to tell us who he picks first, he never gets to say."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Having hard time watching this even though I was really looking forward to movie fights.  Go back to 3 person fights and get rid of the new set.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"A lot of the appeal of movie fights was that it felt like a bunch of friends hanging out slamming each other in a debate about a topic we all love. This new set is so cold and takes away that homey feeling that movie fights brought to us each week. As many said before, the chaos that having 3 fighters brings is part of the charm of this show. I am a HUGE movie fights fan, and will continue to watch and show support and I totally understand needing to start things fresh and to be able to separate from the negativity, but at the same time I think you might have gotten a little too far away from what made the show so loved in the first place."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Oof, this is tough."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,I like spider man homecoming
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,bring back the three person rumble style
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Frames look slow man get another camera
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Love the new format, Screen Junkies forever!"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I feel like reducing the competitors to just two people diminishes the excitement. Where as before it was an entertaining show where crazy yet thoughtful arguments were being thrown every which way, now it feels like watching a high school debate."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Hey guys, been a fan for a long time. Really glad you are back! We missed you all. But like you may have already red the other comments: bring back 3 fighters, try to make it more chill with people sitting, some music into the backround and dont be shy with with a longer format 1h30 its fine dont worry! Anyways love you guys keep going we will still be here with you...good luck!"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,It's not even a competition. Logan won. Best since The Dark Knight
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I like having 3 people fighting, a lot more comedy would happen, and less stiff. I don't like the set it looks very amateurish. I love Hal, but he is forcing a lot of comedy. Just be himself like on SJU."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Thanks guys. I was hoping this would come back. This always has been my favorite thing you guys have done. I love the new set up. Keep up the awesome work.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,I thought Star Wars was a good movie with flaws
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,LOVED HAL AS A JUDGE. I also really liked the new judges system!
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Ahhhh! Change! Me no like change. Change bad! 😖
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Logan is gonna be a classic 20 years from now and will still be rewatchable
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Logan. Not even a choice. Everything else pales by comparison
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,I was with dan until the predator and the pirate captain teamed up.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"1. Logan
2. Spider-Man Homecoming"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Sooo happy to see movie fights is back. 😊
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,This new set looks uncomfortable for the 3 people standing the whole time and that makes me uncomfortable.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I want three fighters again, but I'm glad Movie Fights is back"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Great show! Love the new round types you added and the new judge system! I have suggestions for maybe future fights: 

* Add one more fighter. 

* Change the lighting to warm colors not cold"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"My favorite superhero movies in 2017
1. Logan 
2.thor rangnork 
3.wonder woman 
4.spiderman home coming 
5. Guardians of the galaxy vol2"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,I don’t like this new set...feels uncomfortable cause ur all standing up and making it all game showey......old set was cozy like a bunch of friends hanging out
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Go back to the person format
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Really liked the smaller follow up questions by Hal during the arguments. Kept everything moving along and kept fighters on their toes. Great job guys!
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,My favorite thing on Screen Junkies!!!! YEEE!
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Wow this is so much better than the old movie fights... good job screen junkies
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I'm so happy movie fights is back!!! The only thing is, I wish so much if it wouldn't have changed. The graphics don't look as fun and the 2 person debate style is a little too boring. I miss the fun debates with a third person, usually a wildcard. I don't mind the fan vote but usually the fans don't base it off of the actual argument and I remember the Dan-Mike Carlson fight where each round kept getting 50/50. I hope this was just a test run and they still work some kinks out."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Love it ❤️❤️
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,I don't like to hear the fellas fight no more. :(
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,But keep the sabatoge round
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Ya go back to three fighters...that is all.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Hello everyone!!🤗 If anyone is able to help out this family from Central California, please check out this link for them.  Thanks so much guys & gals, i really really appreciate it🎄🌹https://www.facebook.com/jessica.hunter.31945243/posts/2002734249943480"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I loved the audience interaction,  I felt it added something nice to the proceedings."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"New format isn't good.  IF you insist on razeing the old format, at least go with a 3-way Jeopardy-like setup."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"First off, I'm so happy Movie Fights is up and running again!
Second, I had this idea that I think could work really well. It's called ""Plan B"" fights. After both fighters give their answer, a ""Plan B"" fight is declared, similar to ""Trick Question"". The two answers already given are scrapped and the contestants pick two new answers. For some questions, some choices are really predictable, and having a second-pick would shine the spotlight on some less-popular films. Also, it would mean we get to see the contestants really think on their feet and show off their deeper film knowledge. That was just a thought I had."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,I love this format but add a 3rd fighter
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I have to say, I agree with everyone that wants the three person sitting format back. At the same time, I do like the three judge system. Psyched to have the show back overall!"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Round 2 dan was robbed
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,The montage is great!!
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"love the show!! We know you guys worked really hard to bring it back and we thank you! as most have mentioned, though, I think having 3 fighters would really make it better"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,I like this new format.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,My suggestion for the new format is to let them sit down at the podiums haha
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Really digging the new logo for movie fights. I agree the set looks a little dull but overall I thoroughly enjoyed this and can't wait for more!! So glad its back :)
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,I am so happy they are back. We should be embracing this. Screen Junkies !!! Woo.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,I like either fighting format just prefer 3 fighters bc its more funny
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I LOVE YOU GUYS :,)"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,This was a fun hour. I like the new format. And the belt should have been on the line.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Could you make it back to 3 fighters please
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I like how you are trying to ship this as a more serious debate, with real debate style layout and other things. However I do think a three or four person debate would be more interesting; since now there is actual structure. I would also say, get some gotdamn chairs for everyone, even if they are just tall stools; I know any time during formal debate it was wonderful being able to sit when/if needed. Especially for writing notes while listening to opposition."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I just want to say congratulations on getting Movie Fights back up and running!  I know it's not what we are used to, but a change had to be made, and I'm very glad to have it back!!!  Also thank you so much for giving us Danielle as an on screen part of the team! No Shade but you guys tend to lack WOC, so I am fully on board!!!"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,It should be 3 people
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Please do more guest fighters, the funniest thing I've ever seen is Kevin Smith at comic con's movie fights"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,I don’t care for the new format. I really enjoy 3 person fights. The head to head battles aren’t as exciting to me.  The set isn’t a big deal as I mainly just listen to the podcast but I will really miss the third fighter being there. Also I liked having more questions. Only 3 main fights is kind of dull.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,The OBVIOUS best choice for Disney/Fox crossover is The Incredibles and The Devil Wears Prada. Edna Mode instead of Miranda. You’re Welcome!
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Welcome back guys,  but please have the fighters sit lol"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Why are people praising Thor Ragnarok. It's not even as good as Guardians 2.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,I really hope they bring back flickbait
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Justice League sucked harder than Green Lantern. It was so bad I walked out of the theater. I give up on DC Live action movies forever.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Miss the bell
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Glad it's back, but three fighters and best of five-plus three was better. Just do the old format with a new host (Dan or Hal). Also, standing the whole time was just bad
Add-Even Roth calls it a debate instead of fight at 21:09"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I like the new set and all, but the 3 fighter format made this show a lot more fun"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Not Justice Flop. End of video.





Also... moustache superman."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I love the new format, although I'll miss having three fighters, but this will make the fights tighter and more focused in a way. It was still a lot of fun and funny at times too. I love the sabotage question. You gotta keep that, and maybe use if for a regular round as well."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I love the voting system now, some things I didn’t really like was only having two fighters, three fighters just seemed better and also it made me uncomfortable that they were standing the entire time, can they have stools or something?"

u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,I just want to say I love you guys. You're the best. Having said that I do not like this new format. I don't like the game show feel at all. I prefer the more laid back format that was more like a group of friends arguing about movies. I'll watch either way. You guys are great and I'm sure you'll figure it out.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"If all records are being wiped clean, then I think the title should be vacated. Create a whole tournament around crowning a new champion for a new era of Movie Fights."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Lego Batman was the best superhero move of the year
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Original format worked so good , why change it ?"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,I miss the old format alot. Totally different from the OG movie fights
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Very happy with the new format! It's short, sweet, and to the point. It's fun and less negative, and feels rejuvenated and much more lively! Well done Screen Junkies!"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Bring back 3 fighters and sit down
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,I love seeing Hal around so much again. He was the reason I subscribed to screen junkies in the first place.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,So happy to see movie fights come back. I looked forward to it every week
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,I don't like the fight montage as much and I wish they were sitting so they won't get tired and rush. Everything else is fine.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Glad that Hal is the new host, but I personally think the old style was better.  I'll definitely still watch the new version, but I'll still be a little nostalgic for the old style."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Glad movie fights is back, but the 3 fighter format is much better"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Sit down. Standing up is so hard to watch, I feel tired just watching you. (Hmmm, what does that say about me?)"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,There's too much on the screen!
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I like the attempt, but 3 fighters are better and it should be less formal like a group of friends talking about stuff. Keep going guys, you can do it!"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,WHy the need to start fresh? It wasnt broke dont fix it

u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,THIS IS TOO COMPLICATED BRING BACK OLD FORMAT
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,BRING BACK THE DAN CAM
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,RIP THE DAN CAM
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Cool!
But you really need more nerdy stuff to decorate :D
And maybe change the light to be less blue. That makes the place a little cold."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"the video hasn't started, but i'ma go ahead n say welcome back anyways"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"This is so much better. Everyone gets time to say what they want to say, they're able to go much further in depth, and it doesn't turn into a shouting match. Good job guys"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,I just feel bad that the fighters don't get to sit. And for no reason!
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,This is so weird is sasha there
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,But why is it called Sneak Peek?
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"This fight felt a lot more fun than majority of the previous movie fights. You guys are all doing great work, honestly the camaraderie you all have shown at screen junkies is awesome, it feels like you guys have a solid team now. Can't wait for the rest of the movie fights in 2018!!
(bring back kevin smith for an R rated fight please)"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,I like the giant red Nevada state logo in the background!!

u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Welp, pretty much all of Thor Ragnarok just got spoiled for me. Thanks, Spencer."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Yeah this is feeling pretty stiff. Don't like them standing behind podiums. Feels like I'm back in debate club. I'll give this a chance but I think they went too formal with it. It lost the chill, hangout vibe that made it great."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Best super hero movie is Spider-Man homecoming
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I somehow almost agreed with Spencer in round 1 - nothing against Spencer, but Logan is one of my top 3 movies of the year."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,I love Hal hosting!
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Some criticism? Seems a little too formal. Not as high energy? Has a sort of corporate feeling and doesnt feel as much like a show like the old version.
The overlay seems cheap?

Hal, I love ya and your content (i truly do) but do we have someone with a higher energy / presence who can host?"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Did Spencer say children who like Johnny Depp lol. Sorry but anybody who knows who Johnny Depp is are at least 20 haha or have parents who accidentally fell asleep while watching Fear and Loathing
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I love the new format for Movie Fights guys, keep it up!!!"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I really like Hal as the host,  I really like the multiple judges, I really like the new set, and I don't really like the reduction in fighter I don't really like the reduction of rounds and I think if anything 4 normal rounds and 3 speed rounds would be better. Idk, I just don't like making the show shorter.s."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Add the new setup of Movie Fights to the list of bad decisions made a at Screen Junkies lately.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Part 2...  Well...  Disney OWNS Predator now...
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Loved this new format! Much more about discussing movies and less about tearing down the other people you’re debating against.

u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Guys, I love the new game format! So happy to gave you all back! :)"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,I like the new format but do prefer 3 fighters. Sound was a bit off though.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Please bring back three people. That was my favorite format of any kind of gameshow/debate. It was a debate that wasn't a debate. A podium is symbol of the kind of boring I always fear debates to be. At first, when they said they were going to have three judges, I thought Hal, Spencer, and Dan were going to be the three judges and then they'd cut away to the classic table format where the three contestants would be. ""This is genius,"" I thought. Then it was, ""This is... sadly too much change to me."""
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,May Movie Fights never end!
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,I missed Movie fights. Great new format ( I still miss the old format) this was awesome. I'm happy you guys have recovered keep it up.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Do predator vs aliens honest trailer
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I love movie fights for good arguments and funny moments. I feel 1v1 will make it more competitive and less scripted. Sometimes I felt THAT judge would give a win just to make it to the final question. However, triple threat fights feels more probable for some comedic moments"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Guys, this. is AWESOME. One thing tho, get a third fighter please, everything else is amazing"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Why does it seem like the production quality is lower?
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"The new set lacks ""Pasaz""
And the lighting is sub par? Come on folks help us out here!"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,I really liked it!! I do agree with the comment that the decor is a little bit too ‘clean’ but definitely loved the new setup! Also really don’t mind the change from 3 to 2
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I am very happy with this movie fights soft reboot. Love that there is more of a panel of judges, that way one person does not decide everything. Also interesring that the fan poll actually has an impact now. I do agree with a lot of other commenters though, I'd like to see if you guys can still work in a 3rd fighter but still with this updated format. Overall, just glad you guys are back!"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,a long wait GREATLY rewarded by this new episode !
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Logan and wonder women are the best superhero movies of 2017
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Logas was the best this year
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Justice League followed by Wonder Woman!
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Yessssssssss I am crying
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Best superhero movie of the year: Logan.  
My personal favorite superhero movie of the year: Wonder Woman."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"New Montage: A++++ - it's soooooooooooooooo good
New set: That sure is a game show set
New format: Logically, it's *much* better, I'm early on, so let's see how it goes :)
Movie fights is back: Fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck yeah."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Like the new format, but I think I prefer the 3 way fight"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Spencer’s hans grouper voice was just Michael Caine
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Thor was alright. It didn't feel like a super hero movie, they aren't exactly saving people in the streets, it felt like it was really forcing me to laugh and it changed somethings about Hulk that I liked. Logan was just an awesome drama, then again, Wolverine is my favorite super hero ever."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Can't wait to see u guys in 2018!
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I absolutely love the new opening montage. Like a lot of viewers, I already miss the three fighters, because this seems too timid compared to a group of movie fans fighting over their opinions. I understand that Screen Junkies feels the need to change and distance itself from the past, but that doesn’t mean they should completely change everything. Movie Fights was about more than the host, it was about the fighters and their passion over these fights. If you need to change the format, then please don’t take away the spirit of Movie Fights."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Loved this, keep it up!"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,its back yeehooo
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,It’d be cool if you would bring back 3 fighters
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Where you're wrong, Dan, is that Logan *isn't* a movie you can watch without watching most of the X-Men movies. The emotional impact it had on fans (fans, not casuals) was completely relying on his death which was important to them because of Hugh Jackman, not the character."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"3 fighters, let'em sit too!"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I support Hal as the new host/judge, but I miss the old format. This feels more like a game show, where the original formula felt like the nerdy conversations we have with I friends which I loved. I don’t want to be a kill joy because I’m so glad this is back, but I don’t understand why all these changes were made..."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Logan by a lot
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Let me start by saying THANK GOD for movie fights y'all are two of my favorite fights and it's great! and I'm sorry for this back handed compliment but I was a little worried when I saw Hal up there but he was PERFECT you killed it buddy! I do miss 3 fighters but as long as the fighters are on par with you two (hard to do I admit) it could work x)  (p.s.) if y'all are going for the game show approach you should probably announce the fan poll than have the judges weigh in (I know revers of what most game shows do) I just feel it would be cool to hear the judges thoughts knowing what the audience thinks than it's ""will our judges agree! Let's find out!"""
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,I hope you guys listen to everyone asking for the 3 person fights.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,YES!!!  So glad you're back!
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,I'll take it.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,I like having the judge panel but I want 3 people fighting.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Logan was good but had zero fun and was too violent for my taste. It has a much smaller target audience.

Also Hal is excellent!"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Yay so glad to see movie fights back! Loved it, it might need some fine tuning with the new format but I'm excited to see where it goes next. Plus : loved the new opening montage, loved the ""choose your opponent's answer"".  Might improve: I think you can do without the left bar with all the questions, the show feels less dynamic without the sound effects from the previous format (bell, cheers, etc). But anyway, I'll always be happy to see a movie fight!"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Logan was good but sad because Logan died... But I think either Thor Ragnarok I really enjoyed it or Logan
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,So happy it's back 😭😭😭
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Guardians 2 ftw
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Yo where is that far dude
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,ehhh please dont keep it like this always .
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I'm so happy Movie Fights is back. I'll watch regardless, but I have to give some constructive feedback. I agree that it's more interesting with three fighters. Spencer and Dan are among my favorites, but I'm sure you guys know that some of your guests and even regulars can be divisive, so it betters the odds to have a third. Someone mentioned the table being more ""chill""... I think it might help relax the fighters and keep it fun and friendly if they can sit down. I appreciate that you're shaking it up, but these are my thoughts. I'm glad I can look forward to Thursdays now. Thanks, guys."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,SO MUCH BETTER
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,So happy this shit is back...on the low this is what hooked me to screen junkies
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I might like this 1v1 movie fights for more on a special occasion like the Mantz vs Rocha fight. The 3 man fight was cool because someone could sneak in with a really nice argument like what Mike Carlson would often do. I get that it's mess sometimes and it could drag out the show but it got 3 opinions out there that no one expected. Although I kinda like the fewer questions format it gave way for more in-depth arguments with each question. Plus, I like the 3 judges thing going on.

Also, I gotta be honest I'm not digging the new set. It looks like day time tv game shows. Not to say the old set was the best but it had fan and movie posters plus the toys on the booth added life to it. The atmosphere of everything felt like a wrestling event plus movie theater. I'm guessing everything in this sneak peak is just place holder.

And where's Ken Watanabe's ""Let them Fight"" phrase. I now tie that line to Movie Fights instead of Godzilla. But all-in-all I'm happy that Movie Fights is back and I'm glad everyone's jazzed for it to come back too."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,The 2 person fight would be really fun every now and then but I think if you guys do want to do something other than the 3 man fight it will be hard to beat it. Great show though I'm glad you guys are back.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,The new studio was super weird but I love this
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Bring back old format, this is almost unwatchable. And why does it sound like a laugh track is playing?"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Thor Ragnorak was better than Logan
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"That being said, I understand that a major part of Andy's legacy here is Movie Fights, and that significant changes needed to be made. The idea of having multiple judges is excellent, as well as the fans being a component of that. However, I have to agree with what many others have said, please extend the fantastic informal feeling of your more recent videos by bringing back the classic 3-person melee and comfortable seated format of pre-revamp Movie Fights. I sincerely hope this message reaches you, best of luck everybody."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Love this new and improved movie fight and pls do a leader board and then the 4 best fighters do a play off and a championship plsss I have loved you guys since 2015 forget about Andy although sad let's keep moving
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,I really enjoyed the new vet of the show. Welcome back all.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,I love Thor Ragnorak
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,FUCK YEAH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! FINALLY!!! THanks you guys! The new format is awesome!
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"The new format is interesting, but I kind of prefer the more casual vibe of the older shows."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Great Video Guys, I still miss the old format, but I appreciate the change and open to changing my mind"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Bring the 3 fighter format back. And get anyone else as a host BUT Hal Rudnick, please."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I'm so glad that the show is back!
However, I feel that the new format is a bit too formal - it reminds me a little too much of that Jeremy Johns show SJ+ used to have. Maybe Movie Fights needs the 3rd person to keep the momentum up? 
Really enjoyed the depth in which the 2 fighters got to go into with their answers & having the host ask additional questions (not improv bits) really added some much-needed back-n-forth to the debate.
Can't wait to see what you come up with over the break!"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I liked this fight but I don't know if I would continue to enjoy this format going forward. This battle had your two best fighters but when you have other fighters that aren't as great, it would make the fight more one sided and boring. I loved the dynamic of the 3 man group because how they would undercut each other the first chance they got. I do like the new voting section because the fight feels more fair. I do understand the difficulty of making this voting process work with 3 people but I hope they could try.
As a side note I really miss the sound affects, cheers, and point animations throughout the show. This movie fight was too quiet and kinda bland"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I love all the new changes; although maybe make the set a little brighter. The new format is great, 2 fighters to 3 judges seems more fair.
Glad to see you guys back. ="
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,About time this came back!
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Hal is a terrible judge we need Dan as the judge!
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I understand the decision to go to 2 fighters instead of 3. It focuses the fight and allows for the judge to better control the chaos. But, I prefer 3 fighters. It allows for more points of view over the course of the fight and by limiting the fight to two people it reduces the number of competitors we'll get to see moving forward. Just my thoughts. Still enjoyed the first show back."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,will you all pull a disney already and just merge with the schmoes know please 🙏🙏🙏
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Kinda miss 3 people
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Logan easily.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Lit
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Also, man Dan was way nicer than he should have been going against ragnarok. I can see what he meant about going softer because of the past. However, I don't want his arguments to suffer because he wants to be nice. Thor was barely an adequate movie. The forced humor was terrible. Spencer would have had a better chance arguing wonder woman or homecoming."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I enjoyed this.  Not sure about the two man fights but I'm open.  The set seems a little stark, miss the warmth of the old. I like the three judges.  Roth and Danielle seemed a little muffled, maybe turn up their mics?  

As for the belt:  BURN IT.  

Or not, I'd understand if there was some sentimentality.  At the least, you should have a Belt Retirement Ceremony rather than a handing off."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,bring back Drunk Movie Fights with Ken Napzok
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"So glad Movie Fights is back!  MAJOR improvements all around!  Enjoyed the previous version, but this is tighter, leaner, and streamlined in every way."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Welcome back MF! Everything looks great, just bring back the 3 fighters"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Thank you for bringing this back. However, I liked the old set up better. Maybe because it's the internet and we don't really like change, but the other way just seemed more relaxed this seems like a game show or something."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,ha you gotta stand the whole time now! i wonder if movie fight will go faster now?
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Welcome back Movie fights!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! thank goodness!
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I do not like the new format at all. It feels like any other game show now. Put a table in the middle of the new set, and add another fighter, please. There is no judge anymore,  just a host.  I think Lon Harris would make a great full time judge."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,wow this is my first viewing ever of a movie fights and i am impressed whatever it was before im liking this format so much!
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I agree with others that the old     Set is better. The new format is better. You don't need two people for the computer portion; fact checking and social media. Love Hal and adding sub questions during each argument. Two fighters is fine only if you pick two strong fighters every time. A point for the poll is stupid, people vote based on their favorite pick not the best argument. The new montage is terrible. Overall B- for new MF."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Anybody but me thinks that Danielle Ranford is super cute
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Hey there, I've been watching Screen Junkies for a long time now but this is my first post. I have to say that I personally have been ecstatic with the work ethic and vibe that the crew have been bringing with every video lately, and I support just about everything with the new direction Screen Junkies is going in."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Man I forgot how spicy these conversations get
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Like to see Movie Fights back.

u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,I liked the new style! Can't wait till next year!
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,The lighting seems a little dim in this set.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Thor was not a good super hero movie. It was an okay comedy movie.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I've missed this so much, love the changes!"

u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Will they bring back flickbait?
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Just wanted to add some positivity to the comments... I get where you guys are going with the show and I like it. It will take time to get used to, but in the end it will be a better show than it was."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Glad the show is back — i agree with others asking for three fighters. Also, please let the folks sit."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Welcome back fighters! I'm glad Movie Fights is back, the three-judge system seems fair and Hal is great as the host. I especially liked how he introduced questions mid-fight to bring out more from the fighters. This episode was ok to test the waters and as a comeback fight with just Dan and Spencer, however I think the show will feel a little dry if it's just going to be 2 fighters from now on. A very big part of the charm of MF is the slight chaos and hijinks that ensue from having 3 fighters competing against each other. I also agree with others that it feels a little too formal with having the fighters standing behind a podium, the table felt more intimate and relaxed. One other thing I noticed, and I figure you'll be able to fix in upcoming episodes, is that at some points there were awkward pauses/silences in the transitions from round to round and at the victory ending. Even if they are just sound effects I guess the absence of the 'ding-ding!' at the beginning of each round and the cheering crowd effect at the end was noticeable. Other than those things it's great seeing the show back, and I'm looking forward to the new and improved Movie Fights once you see all the feedback :)"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,I hope they put more diverse stuff and not go back to talking about comic book movies and blockbuster/pop culture films.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Love the new format guys

u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Hal is just a great judge. I like it!
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I like this format.  I like the one-on-one approach.  I will say, if there is going to be a championship match, then you guys definitely need to do a press conference type of hype show.  It's great to have you all back!  See you next year!!"

u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I've really missed Movie Fights (and TV Fights) so I'm glad you're back. I have to say that I miss the more casual feel of the old version. The new set and the podiums with everyone standing is too much like a traditional game show for my taste. I liked the feeling that it was a bunch of friends hanging out and this feels way more formal. Also I missed having a third fighter and more questions, I know I'm an anomaly but I enjoy a 2 hour movie fight."

Not convinced about the 1-on-1 format, and thought the set was a bit ""cold"" (I loved the ""hanging out in my friend's mom's basement"" vibe from the old set!), but definitely glad you guys are back at this, and looking forward to see where you go from here!"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Good format. Nice change
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,i really like the 3 judges but with the fan vote its just gonna be a popularity contest not based on the argument
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Feedback, you said you wanted some

I like the 2 contestants format but you will have to work in a 3rd somehow for celebrities, or it will get mighty boring
The audio sounded a little tin canish
The 2 judges need a proper table/desk to sit at
Maybe have the contestants sitting down, Dan squirmed around a bit"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Logan
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I'm not really a fan of Spencer but I was surprised at how hard he beat Dan's ass in that first round
Dan fell back on that trite and pretentious argument of ""comedy is the lesser art form"", "" not real art"", ""Logan was _different_ because it copied a bunch of movies"" and Spencer just tore his arguments apart"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"It was a solid year for superhero movies. And my list for best is:
1. Wonder Woman
2. The Lego Batman Movie
3. Guardians of the Galaxy 2
4. Logan
5. Thor Ragnarok
6. Spiderman: Homecoming
7. Power Rangers
8. Justice League"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Top three superhero movies.
1. The marvel movie
2. Logan
3. The DC movies"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"My biggest issue with movie fights is people talking over each other.  2 fighters instead of 3 leads to much less of this so I'm obviously for it.  I like all the changes here, good job guys. 

 If I had one suggestion it would be to turn the fighter podiums so they are facing each other.  Talking to Hal they had to turn their head quite far.

One more thing, the first 2 fights lasted 15 minutes each and it's overkill in my opinion.  I wish there was a reasonable time limit to get more fights in.  10 minutes?"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Yayyy it's back!! My dreams have come true lol hopefully they go back to 3 players and longer
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Already people are complaining. Just be happy that Movie Fights is back!
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,I just got back from Star Wars what i miss?
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,I'm happy to have movie fights back. I will miss the three person fights though.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,What comedy was it Dan said in response to Spencer saying how many great comedies do we get in a year?  I listened to it like 10 times and I can't make it out.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Spencer brought the heat in round 1! I thought he had an uphill battle going against Logan and in my opinion, he pulled it off. He really convinced me that Thor Ragnarok is the best superhero movie of the year. He should've been awarded the point that round."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I was really nervous about the changes, but I think I really liked them. This was a good fight. Only thing is I think fighters should get chairs... comfort is important."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Welcome back!!
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"You need a third-fighter podium and some stools...but other than that, I love it.
Great to see Dan and Spencer at it again...can't wait for a title match."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Love Hal as the Judge. I have a feeling he is gonna be an Icon for new Movie Fights.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Welcome Back
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Lol WTF is this!!! Lol
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Weird... at 11:44 the score board changes fonts. The zeros become bold. Hmmmm
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I love the new setup, and screen junkies needs more Joe Starr, him and Dan are the best on the channel. But love all you guys."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I believe that three fighters is better. I really like the new set, but the graphics are really simple, specially the one that's on during the fight."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Logan was actually the most feels I’ve ever felt from a superhero movie it’s so good the ten year build up of Hugh Jackman leads to one of my favorite movies of all time RIP Wolverine
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Great episode, enjoying (mostly) the new format, BUT a couple things. One, I think the fan voting is a bad idea. I feel like it should be a ""help"" but not an instant deciding factor. I think that having the fans vote is more for their opinions, or their favorite, not the better argument. 

Secondly, PLEASE use Roxy Striar as your ""main"" judge in the future (if she is willing to do it). She is GREAT at judging. Watching her do almost 100 TV Fights episodes (which I also hope you bring back) she was not biased (or knew how to keep her bias in check), she really listened to the fighters, she could regulat a match, and she never interjected anything that might change the arguments. She was the BEST judge of the various judges that were on the old format and ""Fights"" shows. (thumbs up if you agree)

As for the positives of the new format, I liked almost everything else. The best 4 out of 7, the number of ""normal"" rounds versus speed rounds, the ""Backwards"" fight and the ""Sabotage"" speed round. Those were done in different ways in previous episodes, but THIS is the perfection of these types of ""trick"" rounds and I loved how well they worked. It feels more professional, it could be great, and I am hoping that this format is also well loved by the fans! (it is by me)

one final suggestion, have a physical (and visible to fans/fighters) timer on set for the speed rounds. That way we can all see it and it adds the right kind of stress to the fighters SEEing their time disappear fast. 

Looking forward to more episodes!"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,3 fighters was much better. wish they kept it the same with hal judging
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I don't like this visual format. Having everyone standing behind podiums looks awkward; too formal, too much distance between the people, and standing all the way through must be tiring. Please bring back the table format and keep the style of the show more conversational."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I’m so impressed they not only brought back movie fights after that debacle but took the opportunity to improve upon it, GG"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Older version was better
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"For me, the fun thing about Movie Fights was always the fun, casual vibe. I think about all my favorite Movie Fights moments, and none if them could ever have happened with this format. It was always a little bit of a mess, and that was the charm of it all. I hope you guys move back towards that style when you come back. You're Movie Fights, be Movie Fights- don't try to be something else."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Do a Rick and Morty honest trailer!
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,It's absolutely wonderful seeing you all come back! Thanks for banding together to push forward and making the show even better.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Happy that it's back but not a fan of the new format. Looking forward to watching it evolve just like when it started!
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Thank God. I have missed this show.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Pls lose the sidebar, or make it smaller. You could put this info in the lower 3rd and highlight the active round."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,They've had like 3 or 4 months of pent up movie fights rage and now they are finally letting it all out in a 1v1 Battle Arena.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Yayyy! ITS BACK!!!
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,That's mean Alicia Malone is back?
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Logan, not even a question"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,You have to be braindead to think any superhero movie since The Dark Knight is better than Logan. That film is a masterpiece.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,I want a String Puppet Action Hero (SPAH) for Christmas.  Thanks
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Love the new set, but add an applause button."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Logan has to be #1 it was a masterpiece
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Love the new set, but add an applause button."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I liked the old style more, felt more like a bunch of friends discussing things then a game show."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Alright! Movie fights are back! But still needs some changes:
-bring back 3 fighter mode
-add a background music because you can hear people whispering behind the cameras
-glad you guys got rid of the ""crappy"" chairs (noisy), but this is a long show get the fighters and judge something to sit
-new set is missing some flare, its movie fights not movie debates guys,
-keep up the good work!"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,I liked Logan but Thor; Ragnarok was the most fun I had at the cinema all year
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I haven't even watched the episode and I can already say I don't like the rules. Most of the game is speed round questions, favors those kinds of fighters. I like three judges, dislike only two fighters"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"My suggestion is for Roth and Danielle to get a desk, rather than an awkward couch. Also, Roth being centre of frame and Danielle being stuck off to the side was kinda strange."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Spencer sounds like a drunk Michael caine
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Logan is the best superhero movie since the Dark Knight
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Off to a good start. SO happy to see Movie Fights back
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,So now there are only two people instead of three and only two or three rounds instead of 5 or 6.....Great (Sarcasm intended)
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Logan is hard to rewatch. It's one of those things where the first time it's great but the more you watch it the more boring it gets. When you know the stakes, you know what happens, and it feels stagnant. Especially at the hotel. It feels like it's a throwaway scene aside from when Xavier has an episode. Even then it takes too long."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Thor hands down. best maybe ever
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Such a fun show! Really interesting and I liked the new set and format :)
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Movie fights is back
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Yeah not a fan of this new movie fights format. Feels really stiff and formal, which makes it a snooooze."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Well logan is one best superhero flim and one of the best film of the year. It be classic beacuse father and son relationship, as well daughter and father relation ships are unverisual themes"

u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,I like the shorter video compared to 2 hrs plus. But I did like the 3 contestant panel. I'm sure these are questions they are asking them selves too. Also love Hal challenging the contestants with question mid fight.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Hal Rudnick padding them subscribers
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,F...k this one hour at 2 in the morning bye
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Is flickbait coming back
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Like the new format. But the rounds seem (at times) 2-3 minutes too long. And it would be sick if you have a tale of the tape like they do in the Schmoedown. Especially if you start from scratch and everysone is 0-0 right now.Then you could have a ranking and the number one contender could challenge for the belt. But I am still watching if it stays as is
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Took my pregnant wife to Logan...she spent 10 mins after the movie sobbing

u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Girls Trip was not a comedy
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,just one thing to say. Spiderman Homecoming was the best comic book movie of the year.

So what about TV fights?"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,The sound is really low
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,We've been waiting over a month for movie fights and Spencer starts with a p**p joke? Really bro!?!?!?
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"SO glad to see y’all back at it! But, yeah, I miss 3 opponents sitting down and fightin’ like friends. I don’t see this format working with drunken fights. LOVE you guys, thanks for being awesome"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"First off let me say THANK YOU  for bringing it back! 
I only discovered the show about 6 months ago and have already burned through every ep. It makes my long commutes, and traffic bearable, and even dare i say something I look forward too.
Now for the new changes I only have 1 real complaint. (the second issue i believe is a non issue because this was a grudge match and not a reg ep. 3 fighters is a must for the new season) The issue I have is with the voting going to the audience. The audience vote is an awful idea due to 1)trolls, 2) the fact that most people who post in the comments tend not to be the... how do I put it nicely... They are not the best of the community of sorts. *yes. the irony is not lost on me*  And 3) and the real reason is the audience vote is not based on the arguments. almost all votes are cast before the debater has a chance to plead their case making that vote in my opinion void , and against whole essence of what makes this show great. Please get rid of that OR only open up the poll after the arguments are done.  
Glad you're back at it! we missed ya!"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I realize this is the first episode back and there is hope that it will find it's groove, but there is a lot to not like.

Like some have already said, the new set is not nearly as relaxed as the old one. In addition, going for a high-school debate tone is not what I would consider a Movie ""Fight"".

This new format simply has zero energy."

u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Logan was the best movie
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,I don't mind 2 fighters. Not that big of a problem for me. Thought I'd add that in as so many people whinging about there not being 3.

u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Love to have you back!!! Want to still see three person fights!
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Great show! like the new set up. A constructive suggestion, I would have liked to hear all the speed round questions, and not limited it to ""1st to 4"". Looking forward to more from a great team!"
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Whoever encodes these videos needs to use a higher bitrate,  I watch a few ""entertainment"" channels and screen junkies and especially SJN has the most compression artifacts by far."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,3 person fights were stupid because you couldnt do Yes/No questions and have all 3 give unique answers. They didnt really need to change the set either.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Any character Chris Farley has played would be a great Jedi

u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Welcome back but sorry guys, it feels like so many steps backwards although the montage was nice.   Buggy sound quality, too much background open air/room reverb on Hal. (Although thank you for putting lavaliere mics on Roth and Danielle, do that with everybody even if you leave the desk mics as props) Graphically it feels like Costco style branding now.  The one on one format basically makes it too similar to Shmoedown but with debate instead of trivia.  The energy is gone.  Hal is a good fighter but isn't the right host for this format, and you can't get Ken Napzok so I don't have a solution for you. The 3 person plus host table format is what made Movie Fights really work and you killed it."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,I like the new format but one thing that bugged me: GET THE FIGHTERS SEATS. I felt uncomfortable just watching them stand for an hour.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I like this new format, and I actually like Hal asking the follow up questions to keep the arguments going. Not missing the third person at all."
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Yeah please bring back the third fighter and let these people sit lol. Also can we get new/old sound effects back like the bell to end the fight and such. Otherwise great reinvention of movie fights. Love you guys keep up the good work.

u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Great to see Movie Fights back but still think Roxy should host. Or start TV Fights again. Or both.
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,I really like this new take on movie fights! I feel like this has a bigger chance to be about the movies and less about shouting at each other. Good job guys!

MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I know Dan said that part of the goal was to decrease on too much negativity, and while I understand the sentiment, I think you lose some of the fun if you lose some of the passion and fire. The best episodes have always been when things go a little off the rails and there's some yelling at real passionate fighting. While it was good to have you guys back, if it remains too courteous, you'll miss out on some of the goofiness we've come to love."

u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Can there only be 2 fighters now?
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I think all the changes are perfect but two things. One, the loss of the 3 person fights. I know it got kind of hectic with that many, but I think that's where a lot of the goofy fun came from. The other change being having everyone stand, as it makes it seem a bit less chill than it was before. I liked having everyone sit next to each other at the same table.

Either way, great job. Your hard work these past couple months is obvious. Can't wait for more. Glad it's finally back."

I liked Hal as a judge a lot, he made it more enjoyable. I liked that you could hear real people laughing in the background (not sound effect). I also loved Hal being able to add little questions in here and there during rounds which changed the perspective of the arguments. Looking forward to this ""new"" show more than I ever did with any of the others. Also no one really shouted over each other."

I'll admit I liked the old set better, felt more informal like friends hanging out. I also find the screen graphic distracting, but I'm sure I'll just get used to it in no time.

p9EP4JPuznY,HONEST TRAILERS MOVIE FIGHTS ROUND 3,Logan-X-23 is the best duo
p9EP4JPuznY,HONEST TRAILERS MOVIE FIGHTS ROUND 3,"With the way Spencer started describing his pick for Batman, I thought he was going to say Kevin James as Paul Blart as Batman."
p9EP4JPuznY,HONEST TRAILERS MOVIE FIGHTS ROUND 3,Dan's OP lol
p9EP4JPuznY,HONEST TRAILERS MOVIE FIGHTS ROUND 3,Worst Batman by a country mile would have to be Tony Cox. He's the 'little' helper in Bad Santa.
p9EP4JPuznY,HONEST TRAILERS MOVIE FIGHTS ROUND 3,"As a Ukrainian, I confirm: Seagal isn’t welcomed here. Also, unrelated fun fact, one of our burnout pop divas once had JCVD in her music video and then paraded him around at some concert as her bestie. He looked very Bruce Willis-ish thoughout the whole thing"
p9EP4JPuznY,HONEST TRAILERS MOVIE FIGHTS ROUND 3,Worse Batman is Tommy Wiseau
p9EP4JPuznY,HONEST TRAILERS MOVIE FIGHTS ROUND 3,Real
p9EP4JPuznY,HONEST TRAILERS MOVIE FIGHTS ROUND 3,"This is very interesting,"
p9EP4JPuznY,HONEST TRAILERS MOVIE FIGHTS ROUND 3,I think I learned Joe has daddy issues
p9EP4JPuznY,HONEST TRAILERS MOVIE FIGHTS ROUND 3,Joe had a strong game! Good on you Joe!
p9EP4JPuznY,HONEST TRAILERS MOVIE FIGHTS ROUND 3,"Very proud of myself. Dan was listing all those qualities of a terrible Batman and I said out loud ""Bruce Willis?"" like two seconds before he revealed it."
p9EP4JPuznY,HONEST TRAILERS MOVIE FIGHTS ROUND 3,"I'm only 15 min in and this is hilarious. (By the way, it' s true - Steven Seagal is persona non grata at least for 5 years here in Ukraine)."
p9EP4JPuznY,HONEST TRAILERS MOVIE FIGHTS ROUND 3,"Who is the worst possible choice ""under 40"" to play Batman?
That's a much better question... gotta exclude all the old actors to make it more challenging."
p9EP4JPuznY,HONEST TRAILERS MOVIE FIGHTS ROUND 3,"That silence of the lambs pitch made me think of when Marc Andreyko pitched the Muppets version of silence of the lambs"
p9EP4JPuznY,HONEST TRAILERS MOVIE FIGHTS ROUND 3,I love these in house fights ❤💚💜💙💛
p9EP4JPuznY,HONEST TRAILERS MOVIE FIGHTS ROUND 3,Damnnn an IMDB sick burn!

p9EP4JPuznY,HONEST TRAILERS MOVIE FIGHTS ROUND 3,Shining re make with Hugh jackman
p9EP4JPuznY,HONEST TRAILERS MOVIE FIGHTS ROUND 3,i love the dynamic between these guys who are so good together that instead of answering the first question they kind of naturally just forgot they were on movie fights and started playing their own game/chattin' instead....
p9EP4JPuznY,HONEST TRAILERS MOVIE FIGHTS ROUND 3,Anne frank honest trailer
p9EP4JPuznY,HONEST TRAILERS MOVIE FIGHTS ROUND 3,SHIA!!!!!!!
p9EP4JPuznY,HONEST TRAILERS MOVIE FIGHTS ROUND 3,"Is anyone else having trouble streaming movie fights videos? For the last 3 fights, the video will start playing and then abruptly end the stream. I don't know if this is a Screen Junkies issue, YouTube issue, or just a me issue? It's just frustrating, I have to start the video about 5 times before it will actually play. Just curious if anyone else has the same problem."
p9EP4JPuznY,HONEST TRAILERS MOVIE FIGHTS ROUND 3,how come no one thought of Eighth Grade for father/child duo...
p9EP4JPuznY,HONEST TRAILERS MOVIE FIGHTS ROUND 3,"Round 1: Betty White
And then someone would counter my argument by saying that it would be hilarious."
p9EP4JPuznY,HONEST TRAILERS MOVIE FIGHTS ROUND 3,"Hope You All Are Well :-)

For the second round I suggest Jason Biggs as Jim & Eugene Levy as Jims Dad in the American Pie series. They are both so awkward with each other but every encounter is one based in Love & Respect for each other & Jim's Dad truly influences His Son in positive ways over the entire series of movies leading to the well rounded Man He grew up to be."
p9EP4JPuznY,HONEST TRAILERS MOVIE FIGHTS ROUND 3,"Love ya Joe but I think Keanu really stepped up in Street Kings too, he deserves some credit for that performance, he didn't start getting good at John Wick."
p9EP4JPuznY,HONEST TRAILERS MOVIE FIGHTS ROUND 3,"Worst possible batman???

My choice would be Lil Wayne....
Ooookkkkaaaaayyyyyyyy"
p9EP4JPuznY,HONEST TRAILERS MOVIE FIGHTS ROUND 3,Steve Buscemi for worst batman
p9EP4JPuznY,HONEST TRAILERS MOVIE FIGHTS ROUND 3,"I wouldn't mind seeing a twist on a Batman movie where William H. Macy plays Thomas Wayne who survives his wife and son being gunned down and goes from mild mannered doctor to gritty vigilante, ala Kevin Bacon in Death Sentence. I think he could pull that Batman off."
p9EP4JPuznY,HONEST TRAILERS MOVIE FIGHTS ROUND 3,"Worst Batman choices... Jack Black, Snoop Dogg, and Tom Arnold"
p9EP4JPuznY,HONEST TRAILERS MOVIE FIGHTS ROUND 3,"""I turned out  gggreat"" - Joe Starr"
p9EP4JPuznY,HONEST TRAILERS MOVIE FIGHTS ROUND 3,Joe Starr go on Chapo.
p9EP4JPuznY,HONEST TRAILERS MOVIE FIGHTS ROUND 3,Paper Moon. C'mon.
p9EP4JPuznY,HONEST TRAILERS MOVIE FIGHTS ROUND 3,William H Macy could be an incredible Thomas Wayne
p9EP4JPuznY,HONEST TRAILERS MOVIE FIGHTS ROUND 3,"Round 1 - Donald Trump
Round 2 - Goofy/Max (a Goofy Movie)"
p9EP4JPuznY,HONEST TRAILERS MOVIE FIGHTS ROUND 3,"I would love to see a Hancock 2. I remember at one point they were going to make a sequel, and introduce an evil super powered villian for Will and Charlize to fight."
p9EP4JPuznY,HONEST TRAILERS MOVIE FIGHTS ROUND 3,"Do honest trailer of The Spoon Movie
xD"
p9EP4JPuznY,HONEST TRAILERS MOVIE FIGHTS ROUND 3,Father/child relationship movie that’s best is a Goofy Movie. Goofy and Max are iconic.
p9EP4JPuznY,HONEST TRAILERS MOVIE FIGHTS ROUND 3,"So many swings, so many misses.  Worst choice for Batman #1: Bill Cosby.  #2: Mel Gibson #3 Chris Tucker."
p9EP4JPuznY,HONEST TRAILERS MOVIE FIGHTS ROUND 3,"Best mature movie series to make into a cartoon?  *Hellraiser!*
We've had Beetlejuice and Munsters cartoons, so the fact that it's horror is no barrier. The variety of Cenobites would appeal to children and probably launch a successful toy line. The story would be about a kid or two and Pinhead zapping through time and space, teaching people moral lessons. Pinhead's torture would involve stuff like tickling and itching powder. All it needs is a catchy theme song!"
p9EP4JPuznY,HONEST TRAILERS MOVIE FIGHTS ROUND 3,I like when these three are on. It's more of conversations between friends rather than a fight.
p9EP4JPuznY,HONEST TRAILERS MOVIE FIGHTS ROUND 3,how is question one not a trick question???!!
p9EP4JPuznY,HONEST TRAILERS MOVIE FIGHTS ROUND 3,"The actual best Keanu Reeves character is Shane ""Footsteps"" Falco, replacement quarterback."
p9EP4JPuznY,HONEST TRAILERS MOVIE FIGHTS ROUND 3,Did Joe describe Mandy and billy in the cartoon question?
p9EP4JPuznY,HONEST TRAILERS MOVIE FIGHTS ROUND 3,You know when you have a great question when each competitor is chomping at the bit to interject their next point.
p9EP4JPuznY,HONEST TRAILERS MOVIE FIGHTS ROUND 3,"I think both Hancock and Wild Wild West should get a sequel.  They were considered shit in their times, but would be considered gold by our current blockbuster standards.  Nay sayers consider the writing of Jurassic World, Star Wars, Predator, Justice League, etc.  WWW is nostalgic enough even for the wrong reasons.  It would have to be good though, or it would be the next Holmes."
p9EP4JPuznY,HONEST TRAILERS MOVIE FIGHTS ROUND 3,Dan's Sean Connery is amazing lol. 32:27
p9EP4JPuznY,HONEST TRAILERS MOVIE FIGHTS ROUND 3,"Best father/child duo?  I can't believe no one said Big Daddy and Hit Girl!
You guys really dropped the ball on that one."
p9EP4JPuznY,HONEST TRAILERS MOVIE FIGHTS ROUND 3,Way to shit on dads.  There are just as many bad mom's and mommy issues.
p9EP4JPuznY,HONEST TRAILERS MOVIE FIGHTS ROUND 3,Louie Anderson worst batman
p9EP4JPuznY,HONEST TRAILERS MOVIE FIGHTS ROUND 3,"Segal wouldn't die in the Batman suit, but he would be the first actor to demand a zipper. And yes, he'd want a zipper that would be as obvious on a Batsuit as nipples were."
p9EP4JPuznY,HONEST TRAILERS MOVIE FIGHTS ROUND 3,Is it bad that I knew Dan was talking about Bruce Willis before he said his name?
p9EP4JPuznY,HONEST TRAILERS MOVIE FIGHTS ROUND 3,Batman's had his time in the movie spotlight.  Especially in the last thirty years.  The rest of the Justice League members deserve good movies.
p9EP4JPuznY,HONEST TRAILERS MOVIE FIGHTS ROUND 3,Betty White worse batman
p9EP4JPuznY,HONEST TRAILERS MOVIE FIGHTS ROUND 3,"Jamie(powerful jre) vs JTE, who is the better live stream editor?"
p9EP4JPuznY,HONEST TRAILERS MOVIE FIGHTS ROUND 3,Wait is movie fights ending?
p9EP4JPuznY,HONEST TRAILERS MOVIE FIGHTS ROUND 3,"Jim Parsons would make the worst Batman, because those watching would be watching for Sheldonisms."
p9EP4JPuznY,HONEST TRAILERS MOVIE FIGHTS ROUND 3,"I heard Percival, saw Spencer Gilbert, and thought Taliesin Jaffe."
p9EP4JPuznY,HONEST TRAILERS MOVIE FIGHTS ROUND 3,Keanu Reeves' best character is easily John Wick!!!!! The third film was the best of the franchise so far! The best scene in that film was the 10 minute action sequence with Keanu and Halley Berry!!!! So good!!!
p9EP4JPuznY,HONEST TRAILERS MOVIE FIGHTS ROUND 3,"Soooo, no Marlin and Nemo for best father/child duo.  I get their not together all of Nemo, but they are in Finding Dory, and their great."
p9EP4JPuznY,HONEST TRAILERS MOVIE FIGHTS ROUND 3,"Damn Spenny g round 2 woulda bet money you picked homer and Bart, Simpsons movie .you have failed this fight"
p9EP4JPuznY,HONEST TRAILERS MOVIE FIGHTS ROUND 3,"Worst choice for Batman: Jeff Goldblum
""Your...um...trash who uh....kills for money"""
p9EP4JPuznY,HONEST TRAILERS MOVIE FIGHTS ROUND 3,I think Gilbert Godfrey is a dead ringer for the worst Batman.
p9EP4JPuznY,HONEST TRAILERS MOVIE FIGHTS ROUND 3,Do an E3 2019 Honest Trailer please
p9EP4JPuznY,HONEST TRAILERS MOVIE FIGHTS ROUND 3,Gilbert Gottfried is the only answer.

mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"LOL..... The only thing this film did was reopen the door for merch and create a necessity for “original universe” sequels.  Other than that, this movie sucked!"
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"Apparently a person can't have an opinion. If you hate the movie, you're a misogynist. If you like the movie, you're being held hostage by Sony or just an idiot. This is pretty damn petty and pathetic that they're being berated by the majority of babies in these comments just for having a different opinion."
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"2:16

mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,I don't like how they turned the female Winston into Tracy Morgan with titties.
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"For myself, the feminist in me loveeed this film - rightfully so, but the film lover and critic only liked it. I recommend it with a pinch of salt."
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,that guy with the beard needs to calm down and stop yelling no one was massively opposing u dude it made me super uncomfortable to watch him screech over everyone

mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,Who you gonna call..? The feminist busters. -_-
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"And now my brain just decided to imagine a Back to the Future reboot with a female cast and a Prius in place of the DeLorean.     :(

I need a drink  😫"
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"Why is changing Blade into a white guy considered racist (i.e. 
blackface) but changing the all male cast of ghostbusters into an all

mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"Dan Murrell predicted a GCU??? I know you're smarter than that. Also, why is everyone giving Paul Feig a pass simply because they loved Bridesmaids?  He also did ""The Heat"" which sucked ass.  And for some reason, he can't seem to do a movie without Melissa McCarthy.  Andy was the only one trying to call it like it is.  Everyone else was stretching to make it sound like it was good. I've never seen such visceral hatred for a trailer like this movie has generated.  And rightfully so.  I'm sure this movie will bomb badly and hopefully that will be a warning to studios who think they can shit all over classics and try to make money off of it."

mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,Feminazis crying misogyny slap yourselves. How can you hijack a franchise that was originally masculine just to push an agenda?? Ghostbusters 2016 was never about reviving Ghostbusters. This reboot is about feminism and the leaked Sony emails prove that. To make things worse the script is crap and the SNL styled comedy isn't funny.
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,So Screen Junkies is not the place to come for honest criticism. Noted.
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,I thought you guys were genuine film buffs?
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"I'm sorry I love you guys but this makes you all come off fake and I almost just lost respect for you guys. Theres no way you would go this easy on any other movie, but that's just my opinion I guess.."

mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"honestly i'm gonna try trust Feig here a little because loads of people thought Spy looked not that great with the trailer but it turned out to be a really great film, so hopefully the movie will give us some more. here's hoping."
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"Okay, no one puts BAD JOKES in a trailer.  The best material is what makes it in to attract the audience and if this was the best they have, that movie is going to be every piece of shit the internet and the WORLD is already calling it to be."

mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"It looks terrible. No frigging way will I even watch if for free. It's that bad. Mccarthy is one of my least favorite people, yech. I millennials want a movie like Ghost busters perhaps they should get an imagination and get a new concept."
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"Are all the downvotes on this video because they showed the trailer in it? They're having a pretty thoughtful discussion otherwise. C'mon guys, these aren't the people who made the trailer."

mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,it looks like a collection of ghostbusters themed skits rather than a movie
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,the dude on the far left looks like the missing link. He needs to be caged.
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"It will be exactly what she said, a great funny movie for parents and their kids from 5-10 or maybe 12. And that's all it is. It is a digrace for the Ghostbusters series, shame on Sony"

mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,These people are about as bad as the movie itself
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"It goes with all the adverts on British TV right now......either making women look (so called) gorgeous, or many where a woman (or women) is making a man look stupid. They seem to forget though that every time they branch out and do something.....Football, Rugby, Cricket, flying, sailing, mountain climbing, fighting.etc, etc etc..... They knew that it could be done safely......because men had already been there.....sometimes literally hundreds of years before. Just more empty feminist claptrap. Do me a favour feminazi's.....go to the top of the highest building in any village, town or city on the planet....look around you 360 degrees, and tell men what they DIDN'T build and what you did."

mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"If you go back and watch Screen Junkies ""Honest Trailer"" for the original Ghostbusters, they note that the reboot is sure to be a ""franchise ruining"" movie.  It's interesting that they said that when the reboot was first announced (in 2014), but before they decided to have a female cast.  Now that they know it has the SJW backing, they know they are walking on eggs with the criticism for fear of being called a sexist."

mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,yea i have my doubts about this one because from what i see in the trailers it seems to be a farce on the movie itself and not geniune comedic humor of scientists actually stumbling upon ghosts and trying to save the world.
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"first off i am 12 and I love Ghost busters I've grown up loving it and you are right that yes it will be less ""spooky but I feel just from those few piano notes playing in the beginning that they will and are showing some of that spookiness."

mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,I love how all the guys. Are just letting the hot red head girl be a complete feminist sympathizer and blindly defend the film..While probably knowing it looked terribly. There is no way she can't see it's terrible. But she continues to defend the film. Women blindly defending women and films lead by women ...even when they suck.
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"Also, since they're a bunch of smart science ladies, they should have put DJ Khalid in the movie so he could let them know that they're smart and loyal."
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"You know what bothers me about this trailer now that I'm watching it for the second time? It is so full of exposition. Like, don't you think that's a bad case of underestimating the intelligence of your audience? Like, we literally need to have the characters say, ""I'm a smart science lady with a big IQ and a degree in sciences."" ""Oh, that's cool cuz I'm the street smart one."" And then, really, there's just a lot of action and jokes presented with no context, and yet without any competent editing or musical accompaniment to make them connect (like a montage or something)."

mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"I don't have a problem with having an all female cast, but I do have a huge problem with the horrible writing, the overly clean CGI ghosts that seem to exist as physical beings within the world instead of the spiritual beings they are supposed to be, and the poor acting by these particular actresses during the trailer. One of the important aspects of the original was the germane acting, the characters acted as if they believed what they were saying, as if everything they were saying was actually true, which of course it was within the confines of the world of the movie. I don't get that impression here. The trailer wasn't even funny. These actresses just weren't funny."

At least give this movie a good fair try. Why is it that a movie should have main male characters to be good. Come on people!"

mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,Reading these comments make me feel like I'm the only one who likes it. I just feel like as a female that the characters are a bit more relatable than the original characters. It feels nice having another all-female comedy.

But I freaking hate that they are making a new Ghostbusters movie. And they were also talking about how this is going to set up a Ghostbusters Cinematic Universe. But who in the world gives a s**t about a GCU? It's so stupid and it's just Sony doing the Amazing Spiderman 2 again by making a movie just to set up others and this one is going to have similar results, just much, much less box office returns. This movie is going to crash and burn. And not because it's female-driven, but because it's just such a stupid idea and something nobody has cared or ever will care about."

Imagine if the Ghostbusters were Bob Odenkirk, Bill Burr, Bryan Cranston & Lavelle Crawford
Vince Gilligan has strong ties to Sony"

mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,Good luck doing a Honest trailer on this movie....I think the trailer is a honest trailer in itself :S
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,Come on this trailer was a stinker. I was on the fence before I watch it about the idea of remaking Ghostbuster. This trailer killed what little seed of hype I had for this instantly. It's the herald of a cynical cash-in summer blockbuster and a case study of Hollywood's lack of creativity.
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,I think this trailer has officially gotten more hate than Star Trek Beyond.
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"LOL, the guys are trying so hard to stay positive about the trailer so they don't get called ""sexist"" by the SJW Feminazis who put this crap film together!

mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"Egon- The nerdy fella that used his scientist talent of math off screen, and didn't throw his talent in people faces. His talent could then be used as a basis of jokes, but wasn't a joke itself. 

Ray- The inventor guy, the assistant to Egon and the one with the least confidence. He has a growth arc, but defiantly is still an incomplete person that is allowed to be grown in Ghost busters 2. 

Spangler- Psychologist & para psychologist and all around scum bag, but street smart and a bit of a con man. 

  Winston- An unemployed black dude, looking for a job that is willing to do what it takes to get a pay check. He's probably the most complete character, as in not as broken as the others as people. 

This mess of a movie seems to be some cookie cutter women that want to rehash old material because they can too! 
The jokes seem to be on par with scary movie 4 &5 and the effects seem to cater to kids and mentally disabled adults. 

I will refuse to see this insulting shit on the basis that this is EXACTLY what is wrong with Hollywood."

Not liking flat jokes = misogynist? I guess?"

mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"The trailer starts out stating four scientists saved New York. I'm annoyed by that.

Well, Feig's Freaks & Geeks TV show was criminally unappreciated, but Bridesmaids is simply not great. Neither was The Heat. That last sequence in the Ghostbusters trailer with the ""leave a mark"" line (which was awful and over-said nearly TWENTY years ago!) and---as the Junkies point out---Jones just SCREAMING at us is embarrassing. Having an all-female cast is a great idea though. The actors are presumably right for the roles and, one hopes, damn funny. P.S. Erin Robinson is too cute/gorgeous for words (leaning heavily towards gorgeous), so I will not struggle to find the right ones. :)"

I mean the original Ghostbuster trailer wasn't all that good either. But the original Ghostbuster is a blast. So maybe this new one will also be better than the trailer indicated. Not that I am all that hopeful with Hollywood being what it is right now."
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"The ghosts looked terrible, the ONLY good looking one was slimer because he's an exact replica. All the others look like the shittest cgi from the worst new Tim Burton films. The nods feel cheap. The jokes are the bad kind of slapstick, literally one step up from fart jokes. But I feel this isn't ""femnazi propaganda"" but a shitty remake that feels like it doesn't have to try because it's appealing to this niche progressive market that's popular right now. Because you just know there are going to be articles about how ""important"" it is that they made these flat, unfunny characters female. Just because you make females scientists that are quirky, doesn't mean they are good characters. And watching this trailer is the same as watching a Alvin and the Chipmunks trailer for me; it's cheap, stupid money making garbage, but for women. Just like I think kids deserve better kids movies, women deserve better women movies."

I felt like they were tip-toeing around how bad it was, like they were afraid to offend the movie studio.  That makes sense if these bits are paid for by those studios."

mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,I dislike and hate this trailer I think your reactions were held back about the trailer. Black hat dude should join politics.
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,The original ghostbusters was a comedy this one is a parody. Since scary movie 5 sucked this one could work and be really good but since star wars done amazingly well i got a feeling it will struggle so i predict 4.8/10 on the imdb website. I noticed a few parodies in the trailer one the exorcist the vomit and the head spinning and from the tv show the big bang theory with the equation scene so it is a parody comedy not a comedy. It should be called Scary Movie 6: Who You Gonna Call?.
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"Violence against women? Brilliant! I like it! 
This will be THE movie of 2016!"
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"The trailer is disappointing. I much prefer the tone, comedy and effects of the first two movies. I probably won't go to see it.

That being said, I will not attack the cast members or director personally over this, and it hasn't destroyed the first two films for me.

Why is it so rare to see this kind of view?"

mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"It is literally hard to watch you guys struggling to review this trailer. You know it's gonna bomb, but you just won't come out and say it. With all the negativity that was going around about the female cast, they line up a group of ladies that kicks ass. This group of actresses can deliver laughs and substance.  But then, they hand them total crap for a script, terrible material, video game level cgi, and an intro that confuses itself as to it being a stand-alone where Ghostbusters never existed, a sequel, or just a remake. I won't spend  a nickel on this one."

mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"this is not a classic.  rebranding of a classic for political correctness agenda is the same as rape.  The CGI is crap too. We were expecting the original cast in order to revisit this memorable classic, instead we got this bullshit. As the old saying goes "" If it ain't broke, don't fix it"".  This one will not be remembered as a classic but as a tool used to further someones political feminist agenda.  Notice the end scene where a black woman is hitting a white woman.  Feminists teaching racism"

A- They kept none of the charm, grittiness, originality of the franchise  
B- It would be cool to have a few women leads, but ALL is just offensive.
C- Childish toilet humor? Really? And yelling something doesn't make it funny people.
I hope this movie flops so bad. It has a real Jack and Jill 2 feel to it. Damn feminists are ruining the world."

We have a bland and corny movie with an identity crisis, is it even a sequel or remake?  Can we just call it a parody, kinda like Scary Movie or space balls, that would fix everything!"
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,Bet this movie makes a ton of cash out of the idiots who go watch it.

mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,I'm honestly just waiting for someone to reboot an 80's movie that was really bad but had potential. BECAUSE THAT IS WHAT A REBOOT SHOULD BE FOR!

mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"I don't mind the female team, it's just there is no humor, no really good plot, and the choice for the cast is pretty bad. And ghost busters is one of those movies you don't need a remake for. I bet the movie theater isn't gonna be filled with actual fans, it's gonna be filled with Feminazis and idiots who never saw the original ghostbusters"
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,This is why I have always hated Screen Junkies
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"I honestly wouldn't give a shit if the entire cast were a group of genderless androids, I just hope (for my nostalgia's sake) that it's a good movie.

mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"Why make it a remake? Why just not continue the franchise? Let's say one of the girls is a daughter or a niece that found their uncles forgotten work, or that crazy stuff starts happening again and one of their relatives is the original Ghostbuster that teaches them what to do, and they innovate it and remake it into a modern setting? Or why don't they just buy a warehouse where the old technology was stored in and figure out how it works and how they can use it?  

Why try to reinvent the wheel when you're sitting on a gold mine of story continuation? 

The biggest insult is not the all female cast or the stereotypical setting. It's the fact that they've thrown away so much good material to work with instead of using it to further the story and maybe establish at leaste SOME loose continuity. 

This movie is gonna bomb, but it will be completely due to it's own fault."

mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"I don't get it, they reference the original ghostbusters by using the logo, the interior of the GB firehouse. Yet they still stand by that this is its own movie with no ties to the original and sequel.

Does this mean they are using the old GB firehouse as ""the base"" for equipment and ghost storage.

So the Chinese restaurant is what?

Was any thought put into this trailer?"
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,doesn't look very good

There's total absence of the certain feeling, the sense of dread that was in the originals. The atmosphere is all wrong. It will be just another lackluster chick comedy wearing the GhostBusters trademark, bursting at seams. Aaarrrghh i'm pissed off. They are ruining my childhood.  It has NOTHING to do with the originals."

mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,I have to day I didn't like the ghosts at all. The looked liked overly stylized CGI and lacked the creepiness of the original. To be honest they reminded me of something out if world of warcraft.

mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"The movie should have been borderline horror. Seriously its 2016!! With the technology we have now they killed this movie  with the choice cast. Im fine with an all female cast but choose more serious actors like Carrie-Anne Moss, Kate Beckinsale, Pam Grier, and Scarlett Johansson. However, thats just my opinion."
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"If the new G Busters are so brilliant, why are they acting so foolish?! Wasn't that the brilliance of the original is that they were too smart for their own good? The blond one just looks like a space case the entire trailer."

They've picked the wrong style of comedy to design the film around. It feels more like scary movie mixed with anything Melissa McCarthy did. Just really not what I wanted Ghostbusters to be (this is what I picked up from the trailer, which doesn't bode too well). The spookiness feels like it's gone too although the ghosts look pretty dam sweet. I would love a Bill Murray easter egg cameo but that can't happen because it's a re-boot"

From what I heard they solved their issues before his death ( Bill Murray said it on the Howard Stern Show Interview) but it was too late, Harold was sick. The original cast had 2 decades to do part 3, the scripts were written but  It never got done. I didn't laugh one time watching this. Looks like another Melissa slapstick movie type of movie, which means we have seen this before. The best movie she did, was with Bill Murray when she wasn't acting all silly,  Saint Vincent . This was a bad ideal and the box office number will prove us right or wrong..."

mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"Besides all the reasons why, that's already stated that this new movie will suck is also because Ivan Reitman didn't want to direct this new one. And one of the major reasons Ivan didn't want to direct this is of course of Harold Ramis' death, and because Bill Murray showed NO interest in returning to be in Ghostbusters 3. Shockingly though, Ivan did produce this puke-fest of a movie."
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,The international trailer is a lot better than the domestic. The movie looks good is the international trailer and not watchable in the domestic.

mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,Rebooting the franchise from scratch was such a stupid idea. Why couldn't they have made the movie about the old Ghostbusters retireing and passing the torch to the new generation of Ghostbusters? That would have been so much better than this crap.

mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"Not interested. I love the idea of an all female Ghostbusters. It should have been the old Ghostbusters not able to cut it and getting help from some paranormal-enthused younger scientists to take up the mantle. They could have used CGI to have Doc in the opening scene getting killed.

Or maybe all the Ghostbusters die and their Ghosts possess or get other scientists (maybe those who don't believe in the paranormal) to pick up their mantle post-mortem. 

They are wasting time trying to create a rehashed unoriginal new universe version. The remaining original cast isn't going to stay alive forever."

mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"There is a pattern I have been seeing with this movie trailer that I haven't really seen before. All of the bigger media sites and social media personalities seem amazingly defensive of this movie, while many of the smaller reviewers have been ripping it apart.

About a decade ago I heard about something similar, apparently video game magazines could be blacklisted by publishers if they didn't give upcoming games overwhelmingly positive press. I am wondering if this dynamic has infested the YouTube critic community."

In fact I think you're so wrong, whether because your simply suck on your own accord, or you've been pressured into sucking, that I really see nothing to gain from your page. I mean, the whole Jay and Silent Bob was a huge moan, and a sign of you going way down hill, but my god."
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"Being ""not sure"" is not a positive response to a trailer. The whole point of a trailer is to make people interested and excited to see the movie. Someone watching a trailer and being like ""eh, maybe"" is not a good thing."

mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"This movie could be good or bad.  I like that they are giving so many nods to the originals, and while I don't really like the rather not-so-good CGI for the ghosts, it is excusable, since that appears to be a nod to the originals too.  The one thing, though, which I REALLY HATE about this...is that it feels like they just took Ray, Egon, Winston, and Peter and gave them a gender-bending.  They SHOULD be giving us entirely new and original characters, NOT giving us characters which are SUPPOSED to be new but really are not!"
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"Looks like a cheap SNL sketch of Ghostbusters with ""what ghostbusters were women..."". Cheap pop-culture jokes mocking movies like Exorcist and more, flashy and empty :D"

mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"Looks bad. I've said it before, I'll keep saying it, this looks like freakin' Pitch Perfect with ghosts. Stupid jokes. Overacting. Stereotypes. I want to like these women, but dear god, whoever edited this trailer did an awful job. Nothing feels right. It feels like a ""now"" movie. So, today's audience, that enjoys the crap we've been getting, might like it, but I don't see fans of the original liking it at all. The humor isn't there. The relatable characters aren't there. I don't mind neon ghosts, I can deal with that. But everything else...I'll pass."

mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"This film has more winks, nods and shout-outs than a meth-head in rehab!

The ghosts weren't that scary looking.
They looked like something out of Harry potter.
If they were more translucent and visceral... Maybe.

Paul Feig doesn't seem like the right choice to direct this kind of film.
Sam Raimi would have been a better choice.

This, to me, looks like one more unnecessary reboot.
This looks more like Scary Movie 6 than Ghostbusters!

I CAN see another Ghostbusters movie BUT *NOT* a sequel to THIS movie."

The cast is the same sterotypical roles they all play, all of which include Melissa McCartney being the 'fat' one that hurts herself all the time and takes the piss out of her weight. You have already mentioned the unfunny Americanized SNL comedy which is a piss poor bore fest, only given longevity by the Hollywood stars that feature. If they were pesistant with a female cast they could of literally picked from 100's of funny American/British comedians who would of not played the same SNL roles/Bridemaids, which was a shit movie regardless of reviews. It's again the typical teenage jokes toilet humour that constantly gets called comedy these days."

mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,Its 2016 so you know...it's got to be a remake and an all female cast and if you disagree you're a male pigand you're not PC!

mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"Yeah, this is a horrible film already. Not one of the elements that made the other films were addressed and there doesn't seem to be any new angle to sufficiently substitute those dynamics. Firstly, none of these actresses are funny. Secondly, it doesn't have a unique feel design-wise - it just looks like everything else Hollywood craps out. Thirdly, choose on whether this is a sequel or reboot. The trailer is SO confusing in this way. Fourth, and this applies to Bay's 'Ttransformers' as well, it's okay make your film - just don't call it 'Ghostbusters'. Make it a new thing. It's jarring to see entirely new characters create the same technology as a foursome and then say it's all new. It ISN'T. It's throwing new characters into a very well established set of iconic visuals and a mythos. Also, I don't care if McCarthy was possessed in that clip, turning her head entirely around would have surely killed her. To me, the original Ghostbusters films now have an ugly wart on their behinds that can't be surgically removed. I can only hope it gets shelved due to the audience reactions like the original Turtles script where they were aliens. I really really can't take too many more of these movie reboots. They are absolutely ruining the originals."
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,I am worried. I didn't want this movie. But when it came and I heard it would be stand alone I was like ...hmmm ok.

So when you do a gender swap Ghostbusters reboot/sequel that is co-written by the Bridesmaids writer, it figures that that means this particular Ghosbusters movie is mainly aimed at women.

mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,The new cast has none of the energy of the original cast. Period.

mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,I don't care about whole gender issue since it does not matter to me so I saw actual problems based on this trailer to focus on instead. It seems like they are trying too hard to be funny by using slapstick humor. I didn't find any jokes that were in this trailer funny at all. Also CGI ghosts are never scary and they are using way too much CGI by having ghosts run rampart around New York.

mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"Here's the reason why I didn't like the trailer. It was spending more time saying ""Hey this is Ghostbusters! Ghostbusters here! Hey! Ghostbusters! Look at this thing that makes us the same as the Ghostbusters!"" than selling the movie. Movie trailers are supposed to make us want to see the movie, not the thing the movie was based on. They did everything in their power to parallel the original ghostbusters, but here's the problem... I can just go watch the 1984 version on Netflix!"

mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"So 30 yrs ago, 4 guys saved NY from demon dogs,  Gozer, and the Stay Puft Man after inventing equipment to hunt and capture ghosts.
Now, 4 women do the exact same thing and its not a 'sequel' of sorts, these 3 women and some subway worker invent and use basically the same equipment and drive another older vehicle (ambulance to haul the living the living, hearse to haul the dead) to save NY, the world? Don't really care. Why? Fanservice w/Slimer, bad jokes, the ghosts look like left over Haunted Mansion rejects, too much of an 80s look to them. Why do the jumpsuits look like someone used colored duct tape on them?"
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,this trailer is a joke its like they took old ghostbusters and took the 3 stooges and made a movie that's suks more then both the old movies and the stooges if they want to make a silly comedy like spy that's fine!

mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,in my opinion if u don't like the idea of this movie then ur not a true Ghostbusters fan....a true Ghostbusters fan would b happy with the fact that we r getting a new Ghostbusters movie n that both Bill Murray and Dan Aykroyd are involved with the development....n if u think those two guys r gonna do anything to disgrace Harold Ramis's baby which is what Ghostbusters was then it retarded....I can't wait for this to come out so all u naysayers can eat n choke on ur fuckin words!!!

mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"defending this movie in any way other then the ghost look okay at best, is a huge slap in the face to the original Ghostbusters. their is no on the fence about this movie it's a straight up bowl of crap. everyone knows it, it won't do well at the box office. I would be very surprised if the movie broke even. Time to put down the weed Sony and stop putting out utter trash."
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,I like how people are saying this movie is gunna be trash but I bet if they go see it they'll say they like it🙄

mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"Sorry, but this movie looks dumb as sh*t. Everything that made the original great has been turned into over the top ghetto humor. The original GB script wasn't written as one punch line after another, it was a scary effing story with characters that were written hysterically. Eff you Hollywood!"
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,The fact that you all refrain from saying anything bad and tried the best to not shut down anything or anyone on this movie just shows that you all don't have credibility to truthfully react or review anything.
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,thank you for not being negative. honesty without condemnation.
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"I will predict 5 million at the box office, I'm being so low cause if it does better welp that's it. But if it does worst it will be great to see the face of those ass hat wanna be heroes of today, talking about the professional victims, social just us whiner and feminazi."
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"the trailer showed WAY too much...this movie looks completely unfunny, obvious, inorganic and catering to the lower comedy-denominator. simply put, looks like a lesser version of the original. looks boring and predictable. not going to see it.

and there were SEVERAL red flags for me. 

*side note, part of the og ghostbusters, the actors had amazing and organic on screen chemistry, didn't feel forced. this trailer? yeah, feels completely opposite."
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"I thought Jack Black was in the new Goosebumps film, not Melissa Macarthy, Mckinnon and the gang..."
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"They tried to tie it to the old one and reboot, that is a problem, make it one or the other. I really have no hope for this being more than middle school humor and no real intelligence."
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"Shut up screen junkies.This is clearly another female empowerment, feminist, gender reversal propaganda abomination."
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,To make up for this bullshit of a movie we deserve a gender switch movie aswell.... What about Magic Mike with all female cast? Thats a good idea right?
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,Watching that trailer reminds me of when I saw the Scooby Doo movie trailer before it ruined a classic franchise that everybody loved... I hope this movie doesn't do the same...
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"I know what they're trying to do with this movie. They're trying to make this feminized version of Ghostbusters, the only one that our kids remember. They tried to do the same thing with Mad Max. I will not take my kids to go see this crap. We will be watching the original at home."
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,Can that guy talk into the mic without having the quick inhale (ah) after every 5-8 syllables?! Seriously!
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,i really hope this does well for everyones emotions and im sick of hearing feminist things and other shit on both sides (everyone is equal considering how much moola you have)
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"I hate the trailer, not because of the female cast, but because I wanted a sequel.  It was so hard to create a sequel with the old Ghostbusters being the bosses or mentors of a new generation? (In a similar way to The Force Awakens).  Even this new generation of Ghostbusters could be all females, it does not matter, but instead they picked up the worst option, a remake that looks just like a parody of the original film. The fact that it has a swapping of genders makes the film much more like a parody.   These days a sequel is a much better idea than a reboot, in example The Evil Dead reboot was unnecessary, Ash vs Evil Dead (the real sequel) is great."
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,Super excited that they put in a sassy black woman with street smarts who doesn't have enough disposable income to own a vehicle but still manages to bridge the race gap with a group of highly educated white women that know how to have fun but also take care of business!
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"You can just see how scared they are about calling it crap, you can see the misery on their faces as they desperately try to find something they like."
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,you guys don't know shit. This movie looks like garbage.
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"I just have to say, this group is being so careful about what they say about this trailer. They are obviously concerned about backlash. All I can say is this trailer made me angry. There were literally only 3 things that made me go oh yeah this is Ghostbusters. Slimer, the Ghostbusters logo and Ghostbuster HQ. The neon ghosts are terrible along with the heavy use of CGI. The amount of comedy they tried to pull off in the trailer is terrible. Where is the spookiness? Why do you have to pull an exorcist bit? If this is any indication of what the film will be like, I am not impressed. I hope Paul Feig proves me wrong, but as a fan of the original films, this is an absolute mockery and they should be ashamed of themselves. I was excited about the cast they chose, all four women are absolutely hilarious, but I feel like the dialogue is forced and their interactions are so unnatural. Definitely not what I was expecting. My last bit of opinion, I feel like the group here on the screen junkies episode was very uneducated about the original films. They compared the original trailer to this one and tried to tell us they were the same. I am sorry but the Original (1984) Ghostbusters trailer made me want more, this trailer made me want less."
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,I guess Sony is paying big money for liking that trailer
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"I'm not a fan of a lot of the cast for the fact they do the same stuff in every film they are in. But this trailer has ruined any appetite I had for this film. Not one joke was funny, the ghosts look like Eddie murphy's haunted mansion fx and that sucked! It's built to make a universal studios ride. Not to be a good movie because ANYONE who liked let alone loved the originals would never make the movie like this. Just plain awful"
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"""They ain't afraid of no kids jokes"""
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,if Sony had any decency they'd shelve this piece of Shit movie and hope people forget about it.
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,This trailer turned me off to the movie. I will probably still see it but I have bottom of the barrel expectations.
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,Excellent point made about the reboot or continuation question. That is a point of confusion in the trailer. And if they can't make a trailer that makes sense...I don't have much hope for the movie.

mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"My beef with this movie is: WHY A REMAKE?? Why not just place it 30 years ahead in the timeline. Old Bill Murray comes out of retirement and trains the female underdogs to become Ghostbusters.
There, i just had a better idea in a YT comment than the entire production team of this movie."
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,personally I don't like seeing America becoming more and more pc. but I actually do think it might be good. I'm pretty sure if this was a remake with a male cast pretty sure it would get the same treatment any other upcoming remake would get honestly. I don't have high expectations but I'm saying it might be worth checking out
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"I have to Say this, the first one was really boring and stupid, this one seems the same, but with better CGI and less smoking...........and a better story"

mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"What utter cowardice. Are they scared Sony won't give them freebies + merch ? It looks awful and everything they said was just vague/positive/bland. Like they were begging, ""look, we're being nice, please don't give us shit, we're down with sjw ideals, honest...."" What a pathetic fumble by screen junkies. I expect better from them usually."
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"Hal - friendly note: you need to stop ""scoop-inhaling"" every half-sentence.

 It's distracting from what you are actually saying."
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"This looks bad. And I'm not saying that because they're all women. I'm saying it because it looks to lack the soul of the original. You could have had four guys doing the same things these girls did and it would have been just as horrible.

They resort to a barf joke within seconds of the trailer.

Patty overplays the stereotyped sassy black woman role. Remember Winston? Yeah, he was black, but he didn't play to the stereotypes Hollywood and others have stapled onto black characters. He was an everyday man working alongside three scientists. And he still had good jokes when his color did come into play. ""I've seen shit that'll turn you white!""

The others...Just feel generic. I don't even know how to classify them. But I got nothing of a feel of the diverse personalities Egon, Peter, and Ray had.

The ghost designs. ugh, neon? Really? They don't look scary, they look...Ridiculous. That big, 'uncle sam on stilts' one particular was laughable. Please don't say that's their ""Stay Puft.""

AngryJoe said it best. It feels like they just used the license to direct another generic Mellisa McCarthy movie. It may have the Ghostbusters label, but the humor and style feels more like an insult to the original rather than an homage."
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,It is hard to see people working so hard to not say what they really think. Their faces at the end of the trailer tell us more than they words about what was their impression about the trailer.

mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"Film makers used to fight against studios, which is why we got good movies such as Ghost-busters which actually did mix between old and young audiences but now film makers bow down to studios and we get abortions as films and it's the fans that fight."

mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"Most of the time, studios show too many of a comedy's good jokes in the trailer. If that's the case with this trailer, this movie is gonna blow.

The trailer has failed in its goal. It doesn't make me want to see the film at all. Kids 12 and under will probably like this movie for the bright colors and slime jokes."
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"Why does everyone say ""yes! the slime is back"" - the problem with that scene is the vomit 'joke' (not to mention how the joke is hammered home by the comments in the next clip) as a method to show the slime.  In the original you don't see Peter get slimed - your watching Ray run through the corridors of the hotel and you can just hear Peter on the radio.  Also the slime temporarily paralyses Peter, an element of depth I can't see them including in the remake."
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"OMG you call yourselves fans and you don't even know that only Ray and Egon were scientists...Peter was a Dr in psychology and parapsychology but not a scientist, and Winston wasn't a scientist either, although there is a mention in the 2nd film that he had been studying."
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"Save your money, go buy ""Ghostbusters: The Game"" (PS3/Xbox 360) it has the original cast and is pretty much the 3rd film give or take some changes. 

I was depressed after seeing the trailer! The time that Dan and Harold put into getting a third film made and its been destroyed right there......."

mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"since the trailer dropped, they've skipped the whole misogyny line with racism now. now a days, people can't dislike something for the sake of disliking it without backlash. ironically, these are the same folks who claim that people should speak out about what they like and dislike about things. I guess someone missed the memo."
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"Seriously, you guys think this is going to do well? Check the like/dislike counter on the official trailer sometime. If that's any indicator, then this movie is going to turn into a flaming plane nose-diving into a volcano."
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"Not sure yet is not a positive:P  Its a neutral.  That means at any givin moment they can either turn against you, or be for you.  That's it.  I mean how do you see a positive in something that can go either way?"

mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"Waste of time to connect it to the original? WRONG.

This would have been so much more well-received if one or all of them were related to the original cast and it was a sequel. You actually mentioned ""Fuller House"" which is a good example of a decades later sequel flipping the gender of the leads. This being a straight reboot makes the all female cast seem like a gimmick."
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,what a waste of money.
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"It's awful and should never been made.

mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"just like ben afleck as batman, nobody likes it, but a couple month later everybody loves ben as batman"
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"Changing the casts gender almost feels like a gimmick, as it doesn't seem to add anything to the story. If I were female, I'd find this use of female-as-a-gimmick much more insulting than a franchise sticking to its origins. It's a cheap, tacky ploy to please the PC/SJW crowd, silencing critics for fear of being branded sexist. It's like they realized the script was shit, and they're using these women as a shield to silence the critics who would otherwise tear this movie to shreds."
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"the only thing good about the new ""Ghost Busters"" film is it will increase interest in the original once they realize their childhood has been assaulted"
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"i felt like you guys had more to say about the movies and were being as nice as you could lol! Just say it, It looks pretty horrible for what it's suppose to be, this trailer doesn't make the movie interesting and it gave up a plot point that i feel is going to be a big one for this movie. I for one was not interested in the movies anymore then I already was, if anything it made me want to avoid it even more. If it isn't broken don't fix it, I don't like these reboots or sequels."
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,This movie is set up to make money on merchandise.  They are making a kid movie with a toy line.  There is really nothing else to be said.  It won't hold a candle to the original.  Its just a way to cash in on a franchise license.  But it depends on what else is released on its opening weekend (or one week before it) on if it will make any real money.  Any competition and this movie will be in the toilet.
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,I hate this remake as much as my period.  #ijs

mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,You guys are trying too hard to defend this abomination of a film. It shat on the old fans trying to garner new fans who know nothing about the franchise.
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,Do women only watch women based movies?? Seems like there was a comment that hinted this
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,Winston Zeddemore was not a scientist!
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,I am guessing that Bill Murray neglected to read the script before signing on kind of like Harrison Ford did on The Force Awakens.
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"The guy on the far right should really not be allowed to sit on your panel anymore after saying this trailer ""Has the look and feel of the Originals"". I'm dead serious. It's not subjective. This trailer has the look and feel of Grown Ups 2 not a Ghostbusters movie. 

Gods Of Egypt has just been outdone."
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,Im a teenager of today and ghostbusters one and two are two of my favorite movies of all time so your wrong there. I think this movie looks like crap due to the fact that it uses the wrong type of comedy.

mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,Is it me or are these guys desperately *trying* to find stuff to like in the trailer.  Like parents trying to find something to like in their kid's god awful painting.

mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"Let's be honest, Kristen Wiig is the only one who fit here. The cast will be the death of this movie. Leslie Jones is the steriotipe of the steriotipe, very different from the Ernie Hudson. 
it is sad. So many good actors to put there, but they had to go with a all female cast.  Terry Crews would be perfect instead of Leslie. For the rest of the cast, Keep Kristen and put other woman in the other roles."
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,Glad to see the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man is back. Oh wait....that's just Melissa McCarthy....dang it!

My brother just told me someone online said they already saw it(with the effects not fully finished), and it was really bad, and one of McCarthy's ""character"" traits is that shes obsessed with wontons. Seriously. Wontons. Of course, I'm taking that with a grain of salt, as you can't always believe the internets."

mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,Still don't know what to think of this movie.
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"There is a fan trailer that has a much better representation than Sony's version in my opinion. But I'm still very nervous about this film. I'll be honest, I didn't like what I saw. Now don't think that I'm being sexist because the GB are all women. That's not it at all! I actually love the idea of an all female cast. Women rock! This is why I didn't like it. 1. The beginning of the trailer is so misleading. It starts by saying 4 scientists??? 4? There were 2! Venkman was a paranormal  Parapsychologist. Winston Zeddmore wasn't a scientist. Get your goddamn Ghostbusters​ facts Straight! 2. If this is a reboot, shouldn't it take place with a total disregard to the original films? (Meaning like the the first 2 didn't exist) That's what ''reboot'' means. So why even mention the original in the first place. 3. The comedy just seems so forced and it also doesn't seem very character driven like the original. 4. The ghost look to bright and have the quality of a Tim Burton movie. 5. Just by what I saw in this trailer, it seems to be crammed with wall to wall Sony product placement adds. Now I don't mind product placement, but when it's made so goddanm obvious in every shot, that's when I lose sight of reality in a movie. Things I can forgive. I can forgive them for the new equipment and even the car. (HOLYSHIT! I can't believe I just said that!)  Shit, even Ghostbusters 2 had some new gadgets and even car had somewhat of a change. I'm also happy that they kept the the original logo. Best bits. In all the best part about this trailer was the 2 second shot of slimer. (Pretty sad, I know) Although he is now a CGI version, His representation is ''dead'' on like the original and not GB2. Anyway, I hope to see another trailer with a little more told about the plot. I will still be attending my local Movie Theater/Cinema to see it. I just hope it grows on me. But in the end I'll always have the greatest one of all to fall back on and that movie my friends was born in 1984. Peace out!...For now!"
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,I think it'd be funny if this film was part of the universe of the first two films but everybody had just completely forgotten any of the events had ever happened. It'd be similar to how at the beginning of Ghostbusters 2 they'd all fallen into obscurity. There could be a cameo where one of the originals insists that they'd done all this before and everybody is completely oblivious.
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"Grow a pair u pussies, none of you liked that shit, f...ing cowards, bitches of nazifeminists."
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,...I´m gonna wait until Netflix have it
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"Don't care about the female cast. Don't care if the movie is crap. 
What I care about is the fact that it completely re-writes the history of the original as if it never happened and yet they still dare to use it in trailer.
Oh they want to stand on their own.. But there is still 4 of them and one is a black non scientist. 
And slimer is in it. What next?
I'm boycotting because it's not set in the existing universe. That's the only reason."
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,You guys are the only ones that like the trailer. Are you trying to be edgy and/or unique? It's not working.
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"wow everything they liked I hated: the ghosts look like Haunted Mansion pansies, the Cadillac joke missed the original joke and exposes the film as a reboot not a sequel,  the processed scene is not funny, the who's who exposition lines are really lazy writing, plus I suspect the main plot was revealed at 4:52 and they missed it (talked over it too). I'm not paying to see this"
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,the gender politics are always going to be a turnoff movies are about escapism especially comedy movies no one wants your gender politics here. especially in such a beloved franchise. but if it was a movie that was good I'm on it soon that would be different The woman cast is a gimmick I mean if you taken on this moment even girl power is its own trope. just make a good movie regardless of gender. and if this is supposed to be something is the movie or girl power movie you're really not making yourself look good at all

The 200,000 more dislikes than likes (at time of this post) already reveal this movie is going to be awful. With all the discontent immediately following the announcement of the reboot, Sony really needed a slam dunk trailer. What they showed was a painfully unfunny mess and all it did was just make everything 10x worse. It didn't win over <anybody> that was on the fence and certainly went ahead and finished off everyone else who didn't even want it in the first place, bullet to the head style."

It was 3 scientists and 1 guy who showed up looking for a paycheck and would believe anything it takes to get the job.As already mentioned, this should have been set in a world where ghosts have been a part of life for 30 years and these should be characters related to the original Ghostbusters trying to continue their legacy."
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"I refuse to see this reboot crap. The movie looks terrible, the Ghosts are horrible CGI mess, the comedy is appears to be complete crap, Leslie Jones is playing a stereotype, and there is nothing here that looks new or interesting. this movie should have been set in the same world, and been a sequel in the Jurassic World vibe."

mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"You can just tell they're trying to shoe-horn in as many elements as possible to appeal to the broadest market. The Ghosts in this trailer reminded me of the latest Paranormal Activity movie 'Ghost Dimension' where the ghosts were simply there to exploit the 3D gimmickry of the film by having stuff constantly flying towards the screen. Moreover, Sony also has a bad habit of selling ad-space within their films (E.g. Spiderman 2) & here again with Ghostbusters spruiking Blu-ray & Crackle in Times Sq."

mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,It bothers me that it falls to Kate McKinnon to be the weird one and that it falls to Leslie Jones to be the dumb one. The gun licking scene among others with Kate McKinnon made it seem like her sexual preference is - to the filmmakers - somehow a joke in and of itself.

But giving credit where it's due, If this movie turns out to be good - or at least watchable - Kate McKinnon should be getting a sizable raise, and top billing for the sequels.( If any)The others need to wake up,  follow her lead, and start improvising.  Oh, and when it comes time to do the first of those sequels, instead of just copying Ghostbusters 2 note for note, the next Director, and script writer would do well to check out The Haunting(1963 original, of course!), and also The Frighteners for ideas."

mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,they're clearly trying to appeal to a younger audience with this movie and it's honestly a great idea. young girls are going to see these four ladies being badass ghost hunters/scientists and be inspired to do similar things with their own lives! it's definitely heartwarming to think about. and if it keeps making fanboys mad I'm all for female-centric reboots of everything.

mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,You regressives are too vaginal to speak the truth about this awful movie for fear of being branded a misogynist. It's sad when the female on set has the biggest pair of balls.

mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"You all were far too forgiving of this. It looks awful. The ghosts did not look good. They were bright, monochrome, with no subtlety, no scare. They looked like cartoons. The original had a balance to it with seriousness, scariness, spoken humor and small amounts of slapstick. Watching this reminded me of the movie Pixels, trying to draw off nostalgia in a very lazy comedic effort."

mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,The look of the movie is leaning towards more to the Real Ghostbusters than anything else.
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,I'm going to say it. An all female cast should not be in a Ghostbusters movie. They shouldn't even make a remake honestly. Give these hilarious women an original script (like Bridesmaids for instance) and don't patronize them by purposefully deciding to cast an all-female ensemble to generate buzz for the movie.
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"it's not about feminist or whatever. i don't care about that, it's about the movie i loved so much since I was a kid. the trailer is bad, i don't like it and makes me feel I don't watch this. this is because i love ghostbuster so much."

mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"Looks almost like how the star wars 7 did all those references super 
forced down our throats. Also licking her guns really why? The black 
character being a stereotype really?  Also the CGI does look kinda bad I
 don't really feel it. Did the OG Ghostbusters not happen cause that is 
what it feels like when watching this I know it said 30 years ago then 
it is feeling like they are doing this for the first time kinda like OG 
Ghostbusters? Also the acting kinda feels forced from the trailer like 
there is no chemistry."
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,Ghosts suck!!! Why are they like Electro come onnnnnnn how can you say they look good?!?!

mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,Just got an watch the original trailer and you can see how much better it is. The first one was played serious and that's what made it funny. This one looks like it's done in slap stick style which is mostly only humorous to children and people who just about as mature.

It was obvious by all of your faces and reactions that you guys all thought it was either horrible or at BEST ""meh.""  The way all of you tried to color it as being good/nothing to worry about/still exciting and then try to actually critique the trailer was just sad."
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,I don't like that it's females... I'm just saying this because of all the feminists out there now. they're fault for making these terrible movies

I love to analyze them, learn the structure of it, look for flaws and find ways to make them better. Nothing is more powerful and riveting then seeing a good film and learning or knowing why it is such. Recently, I started making videos on YouTube trying to discuss with many of you my similar passion for movies that I share with people. I mostly do reviews now, but looking forward to making more analytical videos and of course delve deeper into the art of filmmaking moving forward. I was wondering if any of you would be interested in checking my channel to hear my thoughts on movies. I know some don't like what I'm doing, but I really want to start a conversation with many of you on movies."

mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"Quite frankly it looks like crap. Since when are ghosts neon rejects from Tron? The bathroom humour is just ridiculous. The acting looks terrible. Quite frankly, if this is the quality of the movie, I am already greatly disappointed. The beginning of the trailer makes it sound like this is a sequel instead of a remake. I am pretty sure I will be waiting for video for this one. What a disappointment. I had such high hopes for this movie."
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"ehhhhh, I liked it, but, idk how I feel about some things, like, it feels too ""new"", and I didn't really get the ""spooky"" feel, and the ghosts.........way too CGI, I prefer the original"

mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,well your right they did not give away alot of humor. there was no humor at all
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"Comedy? What Comedy?
Overused tropes, vagina jokes, using the stereotypical token black woman as the blunt of the ""comedic"" value? ""It's a cadillac"" <-- cuz y'know black people loooove their caddies. (No.. not funny at all)

I just see a ""reboot"" of a movie trying to pander to a demographic that probably doesn't give 2 shits about the original source material. (I LOVED Ghostbusters as a kid and still enjoy it to this day, but this travesty isn't getting a cent from my pockets.)
I see nothing but shoe horned tried and tested jokes, one liners and one dimensional unfunny women following the usual character archetypes:

The Dork
The Smart One
The Tomboy
The Token character for comedic relief

^This needs to stop.

I enjoy comedy as much as the next person, but I know absolute crap when I see it.
If I wanted to see a shitty comedy movie I'd watch one produced by Adam Sandler's studio Happy Madison.

With that out of the way, I'll make my way out of the door, but not without disliking this trailer.

 what? Who gives a shit? This is fuckin Ghostbusters. Oh no wait, this 
is NOT Ghostbusters. This is a movie made by people who seem to know 
shit about about the original. The original was creepy salted with 
humor. This is just a comedy show. Nope. Double nope. Big bucket of 
nope. The intro with the 30 years ago is just missleading due to the 
fact that this is a reboot."
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"I loved the cowadice in your 'opinions'. As soon as the trailer ended you ALL went ""Meh"" then had to adjust your opinion for the demographic - Just like the trailer your trying to satisfy everybody."
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,What do you mean they have an uphill battle to keep themselves separate from the originals? WHY MAKE A REMAKE TO BEGIN WITH IF YOU HAVE TO WORK HARD TO BATTLE IT?? The originals are usually going to be loved and that's why remakes are made but if you can't compete with the originals... even remotely... you shouldn't even begin working on that remake. It should be someone else at least and this team can NOT compete even against the worse jokes the originals gave. Everyone I watched this trailer with didn't laugh a single time. Not one among 25 people as we all watched it together.

I don't think it will be worth the wait from the second movie but at least they got the ball rolling again. Hoping it will be good still.
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,Benefit if the doubt? This trailer was horseshit.
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"I'm sure there are thousands and thousands of teenage Ghostbusters fans. I'm not quite sixteen yet and have been a huge fan for nearly a decade. I know tons of people my age who love Ghostbusters. Teens are more cultured than people on the internet seem to think, haha."
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"What a gross concept, of women showing up to see this movie. I would like to believe female movie goers are smarter than that."
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,You gotta be insane to think this looks like a good movie.
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,How did u guys find this trailer funny?
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,Just No.
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"_""The trailer is fi–  fi–. arghh!! Must...be...PC... The trailer is.... f– fff–  fffine!.""_
This was cringe worthy."
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"alright, i haven't actually fully seen the original ghostbusters, so if that makes my opinion on this irrelevant then whatever, but like, I don't really get what's so bad about this trailer.
Like, the slapstick part at the end is cringe but the rest of it seems pretty alright to me."
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,These are things I know.
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"For those concerned that the SJW community will crucify anyone who says the movie isn't any good, they are already slating it for being racist themselves so don't worry."
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"As a female, I gotta say that this movie is going to SUCK, and YES, it will be because of the fact that the main characters are ALL FEMALE. In the original GHOSTBUSTERS, The stories were great because Although the main characters were males, the females on the stories play important roles to the stories, making the encounter between the male ghostbusters and the ghost extremely hilarious, while in this version, it seems to be more like a Supergirl version Superman, Great story, but it will never be like the original. I WILL ALWAYS AND COMPLETELY SUPPORT EQUALITY, but when it comes to stories, ESPECIALLY stories like GHOSTBUSTERS, it should never be altered or chance. It would be the same as making the WIZARD OF OZ with a boy instead of DOROTHY or make a CHARLIE'S ANGELS movie into ""CHARLOTTE'S ANGELS"". It will never be the same."
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,When they say the cgi was the best part... hahaha Very true. Disappointing.
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"I'm not sold on it, being a huge GB fan when I was 5, so I won't be surprised if I see the reviews and they say it sucks. Not saying it won't do well at the box office, though, since the hardcore fans will obviously see it."
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"im a ghostbusters  fan but this is just trash !!! is this a joke ?

mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"My biggest problem is that, to me, it feels like they're doing too much to reference the original films. I mean, it almost feels like they're stealing at least a few of the scenes, such as the scene with the ghost in the library. It's almost an exact replica of the first scene in the first film. And none of it feels like it works together, like they're forcing it. I wouldn't mind an all female main cast in a movie, but this isn't the way to go. But that's just my viewpoint."
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,Its shit!
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,When was Winston Zeddmore a scientist?  Sony f-ed this up right from the start of the trailer.

mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"This movie reminds me of that line from Spinal Tap:  ""The review of your album ""shark sandwich"" was only two words....shit sandwich."""
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"The ironic thing is part of the crowd that this movie is pandering to (the social justice types) are already turned off by this movie because Leslie Jones' character is too stereotypical for their liking (ie., the one woman who is street smart and not a scientist.) I agree, though, I don't know if they directed her to do this or let her act how she wanted but she's exactly like how she is in SNL,"
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"The humor in the original was more natural. It flowed so much better from the plot which was why the original had a wonderful mix of FX, sci fi, horror and humor. That was the genius of it. The humor in this new film looks so forced as do the characters themselves. Especially the Leslie Jones character (hey, here's an idea, how about letting her play a--preferably non-screaming--scientist. Throw a curve away from the cliche. See what she could do with that sort of character). Instead it all goes for cliche. I have absolutely no hope for this film. I'd probably go see it for Hemsworth. Maybe I'll be surprised and it'll turn out good."
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,This movie trailer can be best described as vanilla

mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,I feel bad for all the new generation who this will be there first & defining ghostbusters movie.
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,wait 4 scientist save the world.....   but Winston wasn't a scientist was he?
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"After watching this I feel like these 3 DON'T HAVE THE BALLS to say they disliked it because it has a female cast. One even asked ""What do WE think?"" The ONLY one who felt they could say WTF? Was the female. The three guys talked like they were on a minefield."
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"anyone else this a sequel would have been better than a reboot....  i mean you could use the excuse (like extreme ghostbusters) that any old tech used by the original ghostbusters was obsolete... also given that Harold Ramis is dead, maybe Egon is dead in the ghostbusters universe,  i mean he knew more about the tech than any of the others, so it possibly the knowlege died with him (especially if the plans were destroyed or lost) likely any new team would need to innovate new technology from scratch.

maybe the ghostbusters got sick of being treat badly by city despite saving the world twice.  or heck maybe they mysteriously went missing.

the new team woudnt even need to be affliated with the original team.  just maybe aware they exsisted,  heck maybe they brought the fire house in disrepair for cheap & found some old papers. maybe they already planning to be ghostbusters before they even discover that they aint the first.


(seriously im just improvising here,  but there possibilities, that i bet will get wasted for cheap laughs and empty flash)"
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"I don't care if the cast is male or female, or if it's anything like the original. I wanna give it a chance because I'm a fan of Paul Fieg. I thought this trailer was ok, except that black person, she was annoying."

mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,It was a SNL skit at best. Goosebumps part 2
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"Way to go Sony!  These characters make women look like a bunch of idiots.  It's like they all have the same personality as the character Melissa McCarthy played in ""Bridesmaids"".  Not to mention the many stereotypes revealed in this trailer as to the Leslie Jones character.  Figures they didn't even think to make her a scientist.  Give me a break.  How about coming up with some new scrips and stories instead of re-making movies from 30 years ago.  Oh, yeah, I forgot, it's all about $$$$$$$$$$$."

mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"One of the biggest problems with the trailer was the complete story arc of Melissa McCarthy's character being possessed.  We see her being possessed, we see her doing some crazy stuff being possessed, and then we see her exorcised.  What else is there to see now in that arc?  I think it's an arc that had a lot of potential and could have been the kind of thing that carried the entire movie, but they've killed the whole thing now."

mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"That's something that kind of bugs me, yeah the youth of this generation wouldn't know about the original Ghostbusters but what makes you think they won't get curious and actually watch the original movie. I'm guessing by the time when movie is about to get released into theaters they might also re-release some DVD's and Blueray's of the first 2 Ghostbusters movies to get more people familiar with the franchise and might want to check the recent one out."
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"From the looks of the trailer it's kind of a continuation from the original film. I feel the four actress's can easily pass on as the daughters of Venkman, Egon, Spangler, and Ernie Hudson's character. There personalities are almost the same as the originals."

mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,This Ghostbusters is pretty bad.  I like the old ones. First they replaced the originals with ladies (not trying to be sexist) then they make some stupid traps that looks like they can kill fricking Hulk. I mean the originals just grabbed a box.  I honestly think they should have put other people in to take place of the originals instead of these people.
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,Wish it was a sequel and not a reboot...
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"Totally cool with an all-lady Ghostbusters team, especially with Melissa McCarthy. I LOVED _Spy._ But dear _god_ this looks bad. Can we please stop with this pretense that SNL actors are instantly brilliant? Kate McKinnon was one of my favorites, but SNL cast, as a general rule, _do not_ hold out well for 2.5 hours on their own. Oh, and how hard would it be to make the black woman a scientist? One step forward, twelve steps back."

mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,Looks like a huge huge huge crap!
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"The fact that Sony DESIGNED this movie to be invincible by calling anyone who dislikes it (because it genuinely looks terrible) a sexist or racist, should tell you immediately that this film is not good. Check out the youtube page for the trailer. Sony is deleting negative comments that strictly focus on the script, jokes, producers, or anything else they can't defend, and pushing sexist-accusatory comments to the top of the thread. And for the folks screaming sexism and saying ""what about the sexist rants that criticize women specifically,"" do you honestly believe those are regular folks at home? Does it not cross your mind that it's Sony employees leaving sexist comments to market and sell their own film? They would be absolutely foolish to not take advantage of that opportunity. They're going through the trouble of creating thousands of youtube accounts all linked and liked by each other just to give it a thumbs up. Of course they're leaving sexist comments. Start a war, lose sight of the big picture, confuse the masses, and walk away rich while they bicker with each other defending your garbage that you don't even have to pay them to defend. It's genius. And much easier than writing, directing, producing, or marketing a good quality movie."

mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"A better movie would have been a sequel instead of a reboot.  Even keeping the same cast you could do a decent movie with a good plot.  Maybe it is 30 years later.  The old team has retired and the paranormal had calmed down after GBII, but now there is a ghost issue of some sort.  The mayor of NYC tried to get the team together but Egon is dead and the old equipment is too outdated, lost, or whatever.  The original group is also too old to do that type of thing any more so they go out and find Egon's daughter.  She has his notebook and has been working on some redesigns.  She gets a new team together and that neatly ties everything together.  The original team could be mentors/advisors/whatever.  The equipment, uniforms, and CGI in the trailer look terrible.  Lots of slapstick comedy will not make this better because although the first movie was a comedy there was still that dark creepiness that gave it balance and this reboot really doesn't appear to have that.  The remake of the ghost in the library scene appears awful.   Just my two cents."

The jokes seemed to be forced, like the ""let's go...""-thing. I'd rather had them not put anything into the trailer that's related to the originals. The way it's introduced (30 years ago...) i expected the ""new"" Ghostbusters being the daughters of the original crew but i'm afraid they're not. Just random ""new""... well, girls.

There was no internet, no expectation of a reboot, and people actually went to see the movie, without being told before they saw the movie that the movie is going to suck because 1. Reboot. 2. Feminists are trying to take over the world. I have no opinion about the trailer, because it's a trailer. It's awesome that I'm gonna see 4 of the funniest women together. It's great that a version of a childhood favorite is returning on the big screen. And that's it! I don't know if I'm gonna like the movie or not, yet. I'm not gonna laugh throughout the entire trailer, because it's a trailer. When I watch the full movie I'll share my opinion. And fyi, feminists can be unbiased as well. Anti-feminists, can't."

mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,The trailer isn't good/funny. This movie feels so unnecessary and is a pure nostalgic cash grab. I won't scream feminism but the gender switch obviously plays a significant role in this film's marketing.
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,Why is it that the girl on the panel was the only one with the balls to criticize the trailer strongly?
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"Lets reboot ghostbusters and make it all women??? Im offended by this 
idea. Next unlike the original ghostbusters which has major comedy and 
acting names like Bill Murray and Dan Ackroyd, Rick Moranis and 
Sigourney Weaver... proper A list actors, in this reboot they decide to 
use nobodies. I have never seen any of these women in anything. They 
might as well have picked bums off the street. 

Talk about unfunny jokes. The pace of the trailer was yawn yawn 
yawn. The ghosts didnt seem to frighten these women, so are we expected 
to think they are super hardcore unfrightenable super women?!?  Im so 
not going to watch this crud in the theatre. We never wanted this - why 
is it being forced on us with all the basic required elements changed. 
I've heard also that this ghostbusters take place in a new universe 
where the original characters cant be shown. Honestly folks - I am so 
offended by this whole idea. I hope to hell im wrong as this is a good 
movie, but its not often I get such a bad impression of a movie from a 
trailer and this one has pushed all my negative buttons. Something must 
be wrong for the trailer to do that to me!"

Would much rather spend my time watching the originals again.The ONLY thing I remotely enjoyed was the song, and seeing Slimer. I'm not surprised in the least, though. Hollywood has a very good track record of rebooting old movies/shows from my childhood, and just crapping all over them. But, every time, I want to believe it'll be different ""this time"". Ah, well."

mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,They should have just made another sequel to the original movie
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"Sorry guys but you have been fooled. The trailer is a piece of experimental marketing by Sony Pictures (a ruse or reverse publicity stunt). What you see in the trailer is an edit of the new version of the amateur low-budget cable advertising Ghostbusters TV commercial within the fictional universe (like what Sigourney Weaver watched in her apartment before the eggs exploded). So the reason it looks low budget, cringeworthy and over-acted is because it is a TV commercial within the movie. The rest of the film is a perfect layered blend of subtle, juvenile, dark, adult and geek humour just like the original with a few new twists and ideas. THE MOVIE IS AWSOME!!! Phew!!!"

mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"this movie as per the trailer doesn't look that good, the visuals are nice, but the jokes did not hit or barely hit, the one minority of the group is relegated to playing a stereotype, i really wanted to like this trailer because i love the originals but it fell way short... 1.5 out of 5"
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"This movie truly looks awful. I'm still going to see it in theaters though. It's produced by the same guy as the first one (Ivan Reitman) and the story's by Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis. Even with the shitty slapstick comedy of Melissa McCarthy and the black woman who couldn't play more into the black stereotype if she wore a ""I heart Watermelon"" shirt throughout the whole movie, I have to believe the actual story will be good. Harold Ramis never disappointed.



Now if you'll excuse me, I have to go sit in a corner with my fingers crossed while saying ""please don't suck, please don't suck"" until July 15th"
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"Honestlty, I don't get the outrage at this trailer. Don't get me wrong, Ghostbusters is amazing, but apart from the ideology behind this movie(and reboots in general), I didn't actually think it was a bad trailer."

mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"I know its small, but the ghosts aren't even transparent. The vibe I'm getting from this trailer is Dr. Doolittle meets Casper on Nickelodeon. They're definitely looking for a younger audience, which means this movie will not have the intelligent nuances the original had. Its gonna make a lot of money, but nothing here makes me feel compelled to see it."
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"Are they still making the Male Ghostbuster movie? There has been a lot of issues with it and I think that was suppose to be a sequel to the original so if they scrapped  it they maybe incorporating this into the original universe.  Just a thought. Also I love it, i never thought Ghostbusters was laugh out loud funny, not like Bridesmaids or Mean girls. It was very subtle and I think this has the same tone. It looks beautiful i love that Melissa McCarthy is being gross like she has been in some of her movies. Holtzmann seems like she's going to be fantastic. You guys really need to lighten up some things dont seem perfect but its a trailer and it sets a good tone."

mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"My worry is it's gonna be Bridesmaids with ghosts, don't get me wrong, Bridesmaids was good but if I go to see Ghostbusters it should have the feel of Ghostbusters, hopefully there will be more dark, scary moments and more action. It has good moments and looks like it will be entertaining but it doesn't seem faithful to the original. Reminds me of Evil Dead vs the remake, it was good as it's own thing but it was not at all like the namesake and kind of a let down because of it."
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,If this movie had an all male cast it would have been an Adam Sandler movie.  This looks like Pixels all over again.  Which is exactly why everyone has good cause to stay away from this pointless remake.

mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"I see a lot of hate, all I have to say is if you don't like the movie, or the obvious publicity stunt on Sony's part, DON'T see the movie. Seriously some people will sit here bitching about the movie and then go watch it. The less people that watch this movie, the less money Sony will get and then they'll stop doing this shit. Clearly playing on feminism to get good reviews so news reporters aren't called biased, and you will be labeled as sexist if you call out the movie. JUST DON'T WATCH IT AND THEY LOSE MONEY."

mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"I have no problem with making the ghostbuster team female, not at all, if it is actually done well. The real problem is... this looks like complete utter horribleness. Does not look funny, interesting, or nostalgic. My reaction was much like these fours', not laughing at all and cringing the whole time.
 and why the hell is it called ""ghostbusters"" and not Ghostbusters 3? Makes no sense, this is stupid to be a reboot, it would make more sense to continue on instead.
Why is the token black character the unintelligent one? all the white characters are engineers or scientists, the black character even says they arehte smart ones in the movie, all she knows are the ""Streets"".
How the hell does this ""look similar to the first movie""?! the ""nods"" were just cheap.
First movie had actual humor, and chemistry between the characters/actors. 

also... Gerald butler is this generation's John McLane? yeah friggin right! Whatever... Fallen movies don't touch Die Hard, not even the bad one."
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"I'm on the fence, but I'm optimistic. There was enough to like here to get me in the cinema. Was *not* a fan of Leslie Jones being the stereotypical street smart sassy black woman. That scene at the end killed the trailer's momentum. They showed us a whole damn scene. These trailer editors need to stop doing that. But the effects look really good."
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,The best way to shut down these creatively empty movies is to not go and give them your money. I won't see this or Force Awakens ever.

mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"""I hope the jokes are better in the movie"" - that there should've summed up the whole trailer and the mindset of most people going into the movie. You are giving this movie a benefit of a doubt for a director who excels at R-rated original comedy movies. But ignoring the actors, the director, and even the whole ghostbusting aspect of it - does this look like a good movie? Hell no. If the jokes don't hit their target, then how can this be a comedy?"
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,How much did Gerard Butler smoke before that interview holy shit

mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"I do think they may be keeping the harder jokes will be reserved for later and closer to the date. I do think it catered to the younger audience but you have to remember, the kind of comedy at that time was a lot broader.

mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"This is getting out of hand, don't make such a big deal about a damn trailer being ""bad"", it was somewhat funny imo. Wait for the movie to be released, then you can make your own opinion, although I am pretty sure most of you will think it is shit even if it's not because you already made up your mind, and if everyone hates it, you will too. And if the majority says it is good you will sheepishly agree. PS: this is addressed to the commenters."

mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"I think it was  boogie2988 who said it, but it's so true. All female cast of Tina Fey, Amy Poehler, Maya Rudolph and Aubrey Plaza would have been infinitely better than this.

Absolutely no issue with the characters being female, just hate the way it's written and executed so far. Not holding my breath for the movie and I'll probably not even see it."
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,Leslie jones?  Funny?  Dislike.
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"It's hard to satisfy an original fan base when they're all still sexist brah.. lol Like they failed the moment they casted all women.. shame, get over it brosephs. Just nod and move along."

mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,this trailer is not a reboot its a squeal
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,I'm  just not feeling this cast
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"I dont have a problem with people not liking the movie, obviously not everybody enjoys the same movies and god knows especially movies with some comedy in them can suck real bad. But the thing that annoys me is when peoples only complaint is the all female cast. There are countless of movies with male only casts out there, this really shouldn´t be that big of an issue, also the gender of the cast doesnt say anything about the quality of the movie. Personally i liked the trailer and hope the movie is gonna be good."
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"I actually wish this was a continuation of the original. They could have been Grad Students under Beckman. There hasn't been any major ghost uprisings in 30 years, but they generally handle/study the random ghost spotting. Then introduce their plot of someone else trying to amplify the paranormal. Maybe have the old containment unit go unstable...

Also, the Echo one should have been an Echo 2.

Andy Signore and his catch phrase of not getting enough... It's not just for movie fights. :)"
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"16:50 Equating this trailer to a Marvel trailer is asinine.  This GB trailer sucked.  Nearly half the people in their poll voted ""meh"".  Compare that with nearly any Marvel trailer in the past 5 years and it shows how bad the GB trailer is.  Hell, I don't think the Batman Vs Superman trailer is that good; but even it is leagues above the GB trailer.  

These hosts are too scared to give legit criticisms of the GB trailer because they know they'd be attacked by the SJWs/feminists.  The hosts are cowtowing to avoid confrontation.

They're wrong...  A large about of the GB purists won't see this movie.  For them to make such an assertion is ridiculous."
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,Teenagers like me and younger like nostalgic things like back to the future and star wars. Ghostbusters should he treated no different. What i hate about the trailer is wiig and mccarthy playing the same thing in every movie. The only person im excited is for mckinnion. I dont know who she is but i feel like (from what i see) is a positive part of the movie. Im excited to see the ghosts but the movie looks like shit. I just know im going to dread the rehash story and wiig and mccarthy. If it continues where it left off i would of been more okay but a total reboot is just a lack if imagination.
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,the studio said that this was going to be a reboot but yet they mention the first two movies in the first 10 seconds of the trailer why??? it's either a reboot or a sequel guys you need to make up your minds because if it's a reboot then you shouldn't be referencing the first movies

mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"Notice how carefully the guys avoided saying how unfunny the trailer was. It was the girl who had to come out and say it was unfunny. If this were an all male cast, they would have let the trailer have it and rip into it, mocking it for it's extreme unfunnyness. This was one of the least funny things I've ever seen and they kept sidestepping that issue. The SJW version of equality means ""protecting women from criticism"""
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,initial reaction says it all.

mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"Okay so his first two movies are very rotten, bridesmaids made 169 million, the heat is at 65% and made 159, spy only made 110 despite being his best reviewed film. Are you just four outsiders talking out your ass? Or did Paul feign pay you guys off? Unfunny trailer, that none of you laughed at, gets a pass why? You know it's bad when Andy is the most genuine. Disappointed in you Dan."

mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"Ghostbusters was not a slap and goo comedy crap. I was an epic adventure with good comedy, both 1 and 2 brought that. This one will only bring one part of it leaving it a mediocre remake of something that could have been much better."

mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,But none of the original Ghostbusters are going to be in it! Why not remake it with them teaching a new generation to hunt ghosts?! Much better idea...

mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"Looks a bit mediocre to me, not getting me very excited,  in fact it just makes me want to watch the original again

Maybe the movie is better than trailer,  we've all seen funny trailers for bad movies and bad trailers that let down good ones."
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,No honest trailer this week?
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,it definitely seems connected there's a line in the trailer she said someone invented a device causing all these ghosts to take over...I'm predicting whoever it is it's a character  from the original movies

mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,i dont know why people feel like the ghostbusters movie is gonna be trash just because it is a female cast
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"I'm a little confused.  The first part of the trailer says 30 years ago four scientists saved New York.  However, I thought this was a reboot...therefor, the first two movies don't exist in this universe.   Can somebody tell me what is going on?"
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"This girl looks awesome.

mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"Doesnt seem that good, reminds me to much of a snl sketch."
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"Been watching some of the reactions and trying to dial down some of what was really bugging me, there is no threat, no danger, in the original the Ghostbusters equipment was as dangerous or more so than the ghosts, firing the proton packs was risky the ghosts felt spectral not just a Dinsneyesque Cirque du Soleil  Dia de los Muertos CGI carnival. And the Ecto 1 became a character through that siren. I loved the idea of a female cast but really wanted some diversity in who they were not for them to be female inspired versions of the original cast, they could have done some wonderful things with a female crew.
Its all so depressingly sub par and nothing excites or interests me in the slightest."
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"I do totally agree, the overall trailer looks like a complete reboot but the opening title cards completely undercuts that.   I've got no problem with the idea of a reboot, I'd just expect it to be more honest and the '30 years ago' just seems a bit cheep."
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"The funniest thing about this is the black woman is just a stereotype who does absolutely nothing while the male is a receptionist and all the women have the real jobs that require real groundbreaking talent in science. It's funny because like most movies, it's a total fantasy."

mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"I'm disappointed in you guys. What is this, one of those ""reaction"" videos? You watched an entire trailer in your video, put the whole video and audio in, and did nothing to change it or add a perspective to it.

That's a violation of fair use. I can't believe you guys."
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"So why couldn't a black woman not been cast as a scientist? or engineer?

mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"this guys must be getting payed by the studio or are fan boys of the director(personal friend maybe) because this trailer blows. it's not that the cast is all female, the trailer simply sucks and i don't think I'll see this movie in the theaters. I'll Netflix the shit out it but I'm not paying money to see it."
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"4 Scientists...I'm confused.  Wiig is a professor, McCarthy is an author, McKinnon is a nuclear engineer, and Jones is a subway worker."
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"Well they seemed to have stuck with the ""Don't pay any attention to the black character"" model from the original."
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,It sounds to me like they want to like this so much they're trying to sweep aside how bad that trailer really is...

As a 31 year old male who was born the same year as Ghostbusters and has owned both films on VHS, DVD and Blu-ray. I find nothing wrong with this. It seems to be changed enough to be it's own thing. It's disappointing all the hate on the film just because it's a re-make or it's a female cast. Watch the film first then form an opinion, if you don't like it watch the original. It's not they are try to replace it, the older one will still be available."

mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"Another crapfest reboot. Once again another movie in this generation that has gone to the other side of the spectrum to replace the roles with women to keep the feminists happy.

mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,None of the characters seem believable. The original cast had the energy that their characters needed to be believable. This one? Not so much

mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,Why can't we have an integrated ghost Buster team?
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"Seriously Screen Junkies, could not a single one of you point out that the trailer looks atrocious?! What is the point of commenting on a  trailer, when you can't even recognize a turd when the rest of the internet does. Its kind of like saying Joel Schumacher's Batman & Robin looked promising. No it didn't! This looks like a disaster, and shame on you for not being more critical. Look at all the negative reactions the trailer is getting! Look at all the down votes! Look at how many negative comments Sony marketing is hastily deleting on a daily basis, and they can't even keep up with it! If you believe that this is just a case of overzealous fan boys being close minded, then you are disconnected from reality. Sometimes when everyone says it's bad, it's really really bad."

mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"Any reboot of a beloved movie franchise has a huge pressure in finding a balance between ""hey, remember this? we do it better"", and ""we're doing our own thing"". Each movie has it's own threshold. SW:TFA went too far into reminding you that they're a SW movie. This one seems like it might be headed a little too far as well."
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,looks pretty bad to be honest
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,They fucked up in the first 13 seconds of the trailer.

mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"Well Erin got part of her wish, the trailer not being too funny (or funny at all). I wouldn't be putting money on then having saved the good jokes for the movie though."
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"I totally support female lead movies, even ones that take on exceptionally difficult franchises like Ghostbusters. Except when the females leads in question are one-dimensional SNL scraps. This is no different to Happy Madison taking up the mantle. Two thumbs down. Fail."
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"not sure if the lack of funny in the trailer is a good or a bad thing... usually comedies use all their best jokes in the trailer, which I hate. But here there was litterally not a single chuckle moment"

mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,you can tell they all hated the trailer but are too scared about pissin sony off.
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,I am really starting to loose faith in Screen Junkies after watching this. This movie will be good? GCU? What does that even mean Ghostbusters C? Universe? Just no. Its not that its a female cast its that they are clearly exploiting something people liked. I like Ghostbusters I like those characters but its done. They could of brought back one former cast member and naturally made it 4 girls but instead it like hey a like Ghostbusters ya like girls so here ya fuckin go now you give us I dont know $120 million and we will meet back here in 2 years to rip you off again. This forcing franchises trend needs to end. This movie is everything wrong with movies. And Sony is just the absolute worst I cant think of one thing in 5 years they have put out with any heart or any value and that wasnt clearly just trying to appeal to the absolute lowest denominator. I WILL be watching Movie Fights like I have every weekend since it started because you guys are great 99% of the time. This movie is just gonna be that bad.
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,Needs more subtlety in its humour.
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"Haven't seen the original, but this looks fun :) also the first time I've seen Dan without something covering his head xD I no longer have to wonder wether he has hair or not 😜"
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"It feels forced, and childish. The original humour was natural and grounded. I'm not sure this reboot is gonna work."
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,Oh god no....
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,this cast is sexist :p we should introduce a male quota. Funny how the screen junkie team is to scared to talk about this...

mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"The dislike bar for the Ghostbusters trailer is huge! Makes me happy because this movie looks like complete and utter crap. Also, this reaction video was way too long. I certainly didn't need the last 10 minutes about London is Fallen. Sorry..."

mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,Looks like a srupid bukkake porn with green jiz.
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,They blew it. A reboot doesn't mean you have to start fresh. Rebooting the series as a continuation would have been so much better. Imagine if the girls found the old packs in the old firehouse where everything is covered in dust and spiderweb. It could be as if the old crew just disappeared and everything was left as it was 30 years earlier. The mystery of the missing guys could be a background story arc that could go through to multiple sequels. The rest of the story could have been the same. But this full start from scratch reboot that Hollywood is obsessed with is just crap. Stop with the full reboots and do continuations or the k of something original for once.
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"STOP reboot plz !!! it's always the same... shit movie !!! 

not going to see this shit !!!"

mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"Oh look, a movie with a clear agenda to push.

I love Ghostbusters. I love Aliens, too. But that doesn't mean Colonial Marines is good, just like I'm sure this will be SJW propaganda pushing shit that just disrespects the entire franchise.

mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"Paul Feig does make films that people eventually see, but the thing is people usually don't own them. You see it in the theatre and then it's out of your mind. I think a Ghostbuster franchise can't have that type of response. Also his past films had an incredibly low budget, and a script no one cared about. This is Ghostbusters so he will need to deliver on the next trailer. On a side note to the jokes that makes me worry is that he fails as a director to hold people back. Spy had a few good jokes, but then the cast just kept going on and on until the killed the joke. In that film they literally said ""that's enough"" to stop the nonstop joke making. This reasoning from the trailer makes me question the humor in the new Ghostbusters."

mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"To everyone who thinks this movie is feminist propaganda:

If men had played the Ghostbusters, then it wouldn't be considered feminist propaganda. None of the things the actresses do allude to this being propaganda. If they were talking about men and saying stuff like ""Girl Power"" or ""You just got beat by a girl"" then it would be propaganda, but nothing at all in this trailer highlights actual feminist ""problems"" or anything. So this isn't propaganda, you lazy fucks are just thinking of a reason to hate on the movie."

mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,the ghosts suck needs more practical effects the ghosts in lotr were better
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"I was trying to remain optimistic but I'm really disappointed. While I love the look of the ghosts and the music was good, I felt the jokes fell flat. The original Ghostbusters is really witty and there are actually jokes you miss when you watch the movies the first time. I'm hoping these aren't the best jokes they've shown the trailer, otherwise this will be a disaster. I'm also really disappointed they made the one black member of the cast the least qualified ""street smart"" person again. If they truly wanted to send a message about equality through this movie, this would have been the perfect opportunity to have a female black scientist - a rare sight in film."
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,What was with the 54 seconds of nothing at the beginning!?
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"I have no interest in seeing a straight reboot. I thought it would've been much cooler if they tied these girls into the original characters like their daughters

This comes off more like a dumb down cartoon that's targeting 13-year-olds."
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"Jesus Christ. The new Ghostbusters is an excuse for Paul Feig to keep making comedy movies with his buddies Mccarthy and Wiig. It's not part of a feminist conspiracy. You stupid, easily-offended dipshits."
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,The first movie had one stay puft marshmallow man. The new one has four.

mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,The barf gag was a huuuuge shining red flag. Egon just face palmed in his grave. RIP I don't think this movie will be able to accomplish the smart humor like the deadpan delivery of unlicensed nuclear accelerator pack in the elevator. Its hard to equal the performance of 3 of the best comedy actors ever though. I think the Sean of the dead writers and cast would reboot this movie quite well with the creepy yet funny tone. It can be done but not this time around.

mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"I stopped your video at the 7:28 point, so if you cover anything I am going to type, that is why.
I watched this trailer earlier today and you wanna know what I think.  No you don't.
This is going to be another in a long line of shoehorned nonsense that destroys what could be the reboot of a fan favorite franchise.
This could have been something good, but we have a bunch of unrealistic rehashed stereotypes of female characters who are pushed out because that is what people are being trained to expect.  None of this was funny and the scene where her head spins around was visually weird.  Did she throw the chick out and she was hanging there?  Was she holding on for some reason and the sassy black lady grabbed her and the other lady?  It made no sense visually and then instead of saying the correct thing that someone raised by a Religious home would say, she says the power of patty compels you.  There is nothing wrong with saying the Power of Christ compels you.  if you are going to do the exorcist head twist thing, do the rest of it and don't try so damned hard.
I have no problem with a reboot of the franchise, life moves on, but make it good, bring life into it, don't shoehorn the movie tropes for female characters, don't try to find female versions of the original characters.  Bring in a new group of funny people and reboot the crap out of this thing.
This movie looks painful and so much of it is depressing routine.  Yeah, they updated the ghost visuals, but I could go ask Rob Zombie to do that and he would create some stuff to scare the piss out of everyone.

This looks ugly."

mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"Since the SNL skits that are made into movies end up being horrible, they decided to take a beloved movie and slap in the SNL cast and pray that it helps. McCarthy is not Bill Murray and his charisma is what carried the original any time the pace went off track. They'll be lucky if it makes money. Btw, if you guys are going to review a trailer and say it wasn't great, but then sum up the end of the review in a positive light in that ""families will go see it. I will see it. It looks fun.""....kind of takes all credibility away from the whole piece. Waffling as a critic doesn't work."
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"The ghosts look fantastic, however i'm not to excited about the choice in female actors, also I'm a little skeptical about having to much humor or immature humor in the movie."
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,This trailer sucks they ruined ghostbusters screen junkies sucks
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,Wow the cast even looks like your typical feminist. This movie is pure propaganda.

mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,This movie is a big mistake for Sony and I think we can all agree.

mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"10:00 ummm...I'm not sure how old Hal is, but most of y'all are millennials. The oldest ones just turned 35. Millennials were first born in 1981.

Just saying. We get a lot of flack, but us older millennials are better off than generation X and the boomers in all ways. And the youngest millennials are ten...so a lot of the data about millennials is skewed without taking that into consideration."
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,Sony needs to just stop making movies.

mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"Not funny, not looking good, don't get your hopes up...
This is probably going to be a low-quality comedy, which will be forgotten in no time, unlike the original ones."
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,They shouldn't have shown the possession scene it was too much to giveaway and that kind of turned me off. I like how you mention The Force Awakens which was great not amazing as I truly anticipated. This movie on the scale from good to amazing would be very very lucky if it's even good. Also don't compare Marvel to this shit! They've got heart and content whereas this like a flatline Pixels meet Goosebumps: 2.0
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"an unoriginal, formulaic, unsubtle and completely lacking any nuance. relied heavily on stupid  gross out humour that fiege relied all too much on in his previous work. it feels like a crappy Nickelodeon movie, doesn't feel at all like the original despite how hard it hits you over the head with references trying desperately to get fans of the original to like and a majority hate it. what did we expect the director that produces paint by numbers comedies created a paint by numbers Ghostbusters, who you gonna call? the police, my childhood has been violated and not in the fun way"
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"trailer reminded me alot of the scooby doo movie

ill keep an open mind but so far im worried"
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,Its funny how the only women in the group is giving this trailer the most honest criticism considering the all female cast. hmm.
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,It's almost like you guys are afraid to admit this is bad because it's a female cast.
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,screenjunkies enjoy complaining about everything.
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"The dislikes are because you were denying your only job, Mr. Movie critic.
The movie is dead already."
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"I honestly didn't expect them to be females, but I'm actually OK with that."
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"Btw my sense of the Bill Murray character is that he graduated college with a science degree, even a PHD (Dr Venkman right?) but he was a slacker/conman and may not necessarily have passed due to intelligence or hard work but by conning others/cheating. He latched onto some low self esteem geeks and became the ""cool"" guy leader of there now slightly  less geeky  group.  They do his homework for him while he got to be the ""chick magnet"" social guy they could live vicariously though or who helped them raise their self esteem, courage with girls.----------------------------------------------------or------------------------------------------------------------------------------
He actually was a smart kid who by natural smarts or hard work got this PHD but then got bored or ""office spaced"" and just quit trying. though I see little evidence to support this one."

mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,Worst trailer and probably movie of 2016
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"As an eighteen year old, I can say that every person i know who is my age love Ghostbusters, have not seen two, and thought the trailer was bad.  Love from New Zealand.  :)"
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,Shout out to Rick Moranis for cleverly passing this stinker
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,What's wrong with these guys? The 'Trailer' looked dreadful and the Movie will be abysmal!
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"This looks like complete and utter crap. This is a forced diversity play, almost as much as the Force awakens.  Their roles seems forced, the super model as a scientist inventor (?). Women: check, Bimbo as scientist: check,  Ethnic minority: check.

That last scene looked like something out of SCARY MOVIE-- a spoof

crap"
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"if this is a reboot why would they bother to lay out the ""30 years ago"" rap? i like the idea of one of them being the daughter of one of the original scientists better."
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"I think it looks like every mediocre comedy ever. Nothing of the threat and dark tones of the original. The jokes were predictable and the ghosts don't really look scary. A bit to bright. Nothing against all female cast but I fear it might a bit too female and children oriented. Yeah if they went darker it would probably not reach the big masses but it would be respectfull of the license and the longterm fans. Going PG-18 can work, Deadpool proved that. Going to wide in the audience could water it down to mediocricy and deter the long time fans."
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,I thought 3:17 to 3:45 was very good.  It set a great tone.  The trailer is all downhill from there.
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,Dumb people are going to watch this movie
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"I though Hal had drawn on his arms, this fella is too hairy"
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"It's good to see a ""Ghostbusters"" movie where four females are scientists. Oh, wait, the black woman is a sassy subway worker who's lines include ""Oh hell, no!"" and ""It's a Cadillac!""
  So we're throwing gender stereotypes out the window, but racial stereotypes are alive and well?"
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,Nitpick-  Winston was *not* a scientist.. So 3 Scientists and a Guy.  It looks like Leslie Jones is going be the Winston character in the new movie.  Seems like a bit of a copout

mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"14:30 ""The spectre of the old movie is a monkey on its back""? No-one forced them to make this reboot, the whole reason they're even trying to make this is to squeeze more money out of that monkey-spectre"
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,I think it would have been a better sell as a continuation rather than a reboot.  There would also be less bitching about the cast being replaced by all female leads.  I don't personally think its a big deal but the trolls will be all over this.
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,Thanks! Great video guys I'm gonna be a fence sitter too.

mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"Here's all I have to say. This trailer wasn't funny. Because of that, it is safe to assume this movie will not be funny. God I hope I'm wrong, but I never even so much as smiled during this trailer."

I love Kristen Wiig but Paul Feig is one of the laziest writer/directors working today. Everything felt forced. It has the same look and feel as The Amazing Spider-Man 2, over-produced.

One of the things that really doesn't make sense to me is the opening part reminding people of the first film. If this is a remake then why remind people of the first film to that extent?

mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"It's an unfunny, unnecessary, unwanted, unoriginal, bastardization of an American comedy classic.
Feminists and white knights say it's just fantastic that all the men have been replaced by women, but none of them are going to pay to go see it, I guarantee it. They don't care about the movie, just their own SJW agenda."
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,Is it just me or the intro froze for 5 years.
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"When I heard they were remaking it I didn't think it was necessary as the original I so loved. However I can understand why it was done (a recognisable brand that Sony can hopefully make some money from and maybe build a franchise out of). It didn't matter to me if it was an all male, all female or mixed team. I just hoped it would be good, so I thought I'd reserve judgement until I saw some actual footage (I even dismissed the set photos because they're always taken out of context).

However, this trailer just wasn't funny to me. The humour felt forced and a bit OTT. The visuals are extremely well done, which we have come to expect from all movies these days and the line about the device amplifying paranormal activity intrigues me. I will probably go see it, but it's not a ""must see"" pick. 

BTW - big shout out to the return of Slimer and did anyone else think that tall ghost was homage to Jack Skellington from the nightmare before christmas?"

I have alway loved screen junkies but you are seriously making me not want to watch. It's always the same you are really negative about just about everything then you say or agree about someone else's positive just so you can save face when people call you out. You continuously contradict yourself on everything it's like you don't realize that you are on camera and people will call out your 180' negative bulshit.
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"Where is that confirmed that it's not in any way connected? This feels like it's connected, and I think one of them probably is related to one of the original team."

mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,This is probably the most funny reaction. video I have ever seen. They clearly did not like the trailer but are working SO hard to not say anything bad about it or the movie.
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"it would have been better if they tied it into the original with the new ghostbusters being siblings of the old, with guest appearances from the originals, like star wars bringing back the old stars. that way it would give those new to ghostbusters a reason to watch the original it would open up a bigger storyline if they wanted to make sequels"

mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,pass
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,I'm confused. Is it set in the same universe or is it a reboot? I see evidence of both. And it's the same characters. 3 white scientists with an everyman black person.
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,Looks like garbo
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"The opening title cards really threw me off too.  Acknowledging the previous films and then running through more or less the same origin story had me asking whether this was a reboot or a sequel at the end, and honestly I can't say which one I would prefer more.  There are plenty of films right now that are making ridiculous money on continuity porn, with stories from one movie leading into another, so it seems like a straight-up reboot would be throwing that out entirely.  But then, I can also totally understand not wanting to make this a direct sequel, since the chance is there to have the fans outright reject the new team... although that wasn't such an issue with the follow-up teams in the animated shows and the comics, oddly.

My issue with the film is that the jokes in the trailer are just not landing.  I liked the 'Let's go' bit enough to crack a smile, but then the wig gag just seemed to come out of nowhere and fell flatter than a steamrolled pancake.  It makes the entire film look loud and dumb.  I agree that the film is probably going to attract some young fans and might even make it's money back, but I'm not holding my breath for a Ghostbusters franchise revival stemming from this film."

mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"I would of not liked Olympus Has Fallen as much if that kid wasn't found and taken to safety in like 10 minutes. I thought at first that the kid was going to get found, taken to the bunker, and held ransom so Butler and the president would have to cooperate, but i loved when they got him out of the white house and safe, so the film could go back to the action and not the cliche hostage movie ending"
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"I don't mean to upset anyone but...
1. the characters seemed kind of flat to me
2. I don't remember if we were given an answer but, is their any reason why all four of them are girls? Not that I mind but like I said, the characters seemed kind of flat to me.
3. Is this really not connecting to the original ghost busters, because the beginning really give that impression.
4. I hope they don't just assign different stereotypes for each characters."
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"The cast I think is fine, and really I think this could have been a great funny reboot, but they shit the bed unless this trailer showed all the worst parts. They didn't change anything, same plot points, same off beat black token, heck the same car. I don't know why they were so afraid of doing something special. It's disappointing to see so many talented actresses (and Hemsworth) go to waste on this piece of crap."

mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,I liked it.  I think it will be fine and be one of the top 10 earners of the year.  It has no competition the weekend it comes out.  I've seen the trailer a few times and I laugh every time Jones smacks McCarthy.

mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,meh. Ghostbusters trailer wasn't impressive. Looked like stupid humour--sorta slap sticky whatever stuff so I dunno. Probably won't see it. Would rather see London Has Fallen. Fun action movie. Looks good enough. Liked the first one so I should like this next one. :)

mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"I actually like the cast, they are funny and talented actresses. As long as it's lighthearted, funny and plays to the strengths of the cast I can look past the fact that the feminist cunts of the world have decided to emasculate every cool movie from the 80's."
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"Sony is deleting comments on the trailer, I just mentioned it was Pixels meets Scooby Doo ghosts CGI xD. did say I would still go see it.

mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,The dead silence while they watched the trailer is all you need to know.
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"Let´s face it: Ghostbusters 2 was crap. It was boring and not funny. The first one was fresh, sometimes funny and a good film. The trailer felts that this movie probably it´s gonna be a ""meh"", but not that bad like Crap4stastic. The new Ecto car looks cool."

mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,This looks like a terrible SNL sketch.
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,'Twas pretty shitty
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,Looks pretty lame. :/
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"The trailer was horrible because everything it's comprised of it atrocious. The homages, the premise, the tone, it's all a gigantic mess. They're trying to present the film to a ""certain audience"" while also trying to make it have a more serious tone. Remember how the trailers for Jurassic World featured a rather creepy version of the Jurassic Park theme? They did the same here, and it just doesn't work. It makes the film seem extremely dark and serious, which it's not. Even the CGI, I felt, looked too serious. The effects look great, but they really should go with a more cartoonish look for the ghosts, not something highly detailed and potentially outright terrifying. The trailer was just painful to watch - as hard as it may have tried to make the film look good, there was no way it could succeed in doing so."
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,Never liked the originals... so this one is a no no.
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"Ghostbusters 1 was originally penned in part as a horror film and the humour grew out of that in later rewrites. I think you could really feel that in the film; they actually took the premise quite seriously and overlaid it with the memorable dry humour, sarcasm and wit which still holds up today. The characters felt real and had real motivations and depth rather than just being caricatures. By comparison, the reboot appears to be a soulless and shallow parody with lame, obvious jokes and stereotyped characters (I guess that's what happens when your casting choices are determined entirely by gender rather than who would best fill the roles of properly developed characters). I think the character contrast is most obvious with Leslie Jones when compared to Ernie Hudson in the originals. Even though Ernie's character was underdeveloped it was clear that he was just meant to represent a normal guy (not a scientist or believer in ghosts at all) who was hard on his luck and would take any job that paid. He happened to be a black guy but he had far more depth than that and it wasn't an essential part of his character. Jones's character looks to be just stereotypical sassy black woman #5623. Maybe you think I'm taking far too much from a short trailer but that's just the impression it has given me. It felt like a sketch rather than a trailer for an entire film."
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"Bad, bad, bad.. it looks like Pixels and Scooby Doo had a dopey and needless love child.. let's hope it gets MUCH better."
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"Looked flat, and frankly re-hashed; it's not about who's in the role either, mad max fury road could easily have been called Furiosa begins for my money, the best role/actor in the movie."
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"Were the first Ghostbusters movies supposed to be funny? I always thought that was the great part, it had funny moments, but I never saw it as a funny movie. They are trying to make this into a comedy movie and I just don't see it."

mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"No soul, feels like a bunch of lazy sketches and rehashed ideas. Jokes sucked. Ramis had a philosophy as a filmmaker and writer, a philosophy that revolved around earning your story, your world, your characters. It revolved around having the characters make simple choices we can buy and follow and because we could do that we could invest. This movie it's easy to see does not have that philosophy. It's doomed to being at best an 'eh.'"

mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,Apparently it's a reboot but that opening definitely made me think it's continuation. Why mention 30 years a go four scientists saved new york if the other films didn't happen in this universe :/

mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,Am I the only one who really hates the CGI Special effects. Honestly Ghost Busters 1984 looked way better.  Too much CGI and not enough practical effects. Even the head turning was awfully done.
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,Wheres the honest trailer
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"Andy, the original Ghostbusters was PG, and clearly that didn't prevent it from being amazing. But, you think a PG-13 and not full R movie will make it a lesser movie? I am confused.

I personally thought the trailer was fine, as Dan said. I think they were between a rock and a hard place. What was everyone's concerns? That Melissa McCarthy would be Tammy. That Kristen Wiig would be over-the-top. So, yeah, I think they went with understated but I am not going to begrudge them for that because if it had been wacky, I would have been completely checked out."
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,yeah Erin! So good to see you! Can you please show up in more Screen Junkies videos?
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"it looks ridiculously fake, and the humour ugh thats going to be terrible.. they said ""let's go!"" at the same time! get it? thats funny because they interrupted each other. uuuuugh"
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,Original Ghostbuster and now the new all women Ghostbusters have the token black guy/chick... Ugh...
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"I saw Erin interviewing people on the red carpet in a video before, and I was struck by how much more attractive she was than the movie stars...I think even the actresses she was interviewing were aware of it and were feeling a bit out-shined. Beautiful lady. Hats off to Morgan! He knows what's up! :D"
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"Considering the reaction to the actual trailer and the fact that Sony are deleting negative comments, I'm surprised at how reserved and almost positive this reaction video is."
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"This movie looks horrible from that trailer, the concept of this all female Ghostbusters reboot is dumb and forced. I don't mind there being one or two female Ghostbusters and a couple male ones, but to go all female is just silly and unnecessary. 

Also, why not do this as a reboot and a sequel? It certainly worked for Star Wars, and it could have easily worked here and made old fans want to watch the movie more? Smh, so many missed opportunities in how this movie was handled."
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"""It felt like it was trying too hard"" ... Erin, that's pretty much every Melissa McCarthy movie. =\

I had a feeling that I wasn't going to like it, and I wasn't far off.  To be fair, I just don't like Melissa McCarthy's or Kristin Wiig's comedy.  The prior focuses too much on being the bumbling dolt that makes gross-out humor and the latter is just too dry (delivery-wise) for my tastes -- it reminds me of British humor, which is usually hit or miss with me.  It only took seeing the slime-spewing scene at the beginning to set the tone for me, and I know... someone is going to say, ""Well, Venkman got slimed in the first Ghostbusters movie!""  Yes, he did, but the humor in that scene wasn't about the fact that he got slimed, it was in Stantz's (Akroyd's) gleeful response to it and Venkman's response to that.

All in all, I'll still give it a shot, *IF* the reviews come out giving it positive praise.  I don't really want to see another trailer, because I'd like to avoid spoiling any other scenes."
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,looks like dragonball evolution of ghostbusters
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"Trailer is so cringey my face caved in, film will no doubt be just as bad or worse. No, it's not because I'm a mysogynist, I'm not, I just know shit when I see it."
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"I could care less about the female cast, but what is the point of making a new movie if it follows the exact same plot as the original? That ruined star wars for me, once I seen the new death star (star killer base or whatever it was called) I just wasn't interested any more, and from what I understand, this movie pretty much is the same as the original."

mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"I love how a lot of people were crapping on people on youtube who react to trailers and now Jeremy Jahns has done it a little bit, the Schmoes have started doing it after they had Tyrone Magnus on their podcast, and now the Screen Junkies after they had Ryan RIght from The Reel Rejects on their Movie Fights show. I know not all react channels go into depth on their subject but enough of the top ones do so don't hate on them so much when other movie channels are doing them a bit too now."

mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,Every story that has needed to be told in the Ghostbusters universe has been told in the form of an awesome Saturday Morning Cartoon called Slimer and the Real Ghostbusters that trailer was a steaming pile of shit.

I don't understand the slime-vomiting as a result. If the context in the movie is that the ghost had died of poisoning I'll let it pass. But a ""vomit scare attack"", I'm just not on board with."

mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,I love how Erin likes it solely because it has women. When the guy was asked about it he looked at her and was like yeah it looks decent. Without a doubt they would have shit on it if she wasn't there.

They want to be treated like men, so don't use kid gloves. If they were men, you guys would be way harsher.

mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"Probably gonna get a lot of down votes but...

I'm worried that they opted for an all-female cast. Combined with this trailer it gives me the feeling not of 'we're trying to bring it to a new, modern, era' or even 'we are going to do our own take' but instead 'anything a guy can do a girl can do better! And if you don't like it you're sexist!'

Putting that aside so much of it seemed uninteresting or confusing. What's the point of a laser bear trap when some of these ghosts don't even have legs? Or could fly? Or simply be huge? Can you imagine trying to capture the Stay-puft in a bear trap? The Ecto 1 being a herse actually had me thinking it was clever (the vehicle for the dead being used to reign in the undead) until that dumb catilac line came out. The slapping thing also felt predictable as ****.

I kinda feel like this is going to be a lazy retread with a focus on girl power and lazy parroting of the original."

mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"The pacing felt slow, and there are clearly hints towards appeasing a female audience. The humor was a bit too physical based too. Plus there were a little too many  'nods' from the original, making it kinda feel like a 'hey, remember this from the old ghostbusters movie?' thing. But...I still think it will be fun to watch. Eventually. Once it's on sale on DVD for 5 euro or something."

mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,The original ghost busters was scary when I was a kid. A parity of comedy & horror. This remake looks like a happy Madison SNL production.

mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,I think it looks great! I liked it :)
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,Only thing I can say is the ghosts look pretty cool. But not feeling his movie. They flat out said this has nothing to do with the original and yet they mention the original team at the start of the trailer. Confusing as hell.

mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"She said she hopes they didn't put the funniest jokes in the trailer. It's a comedy.

mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"Ok Sony Pictures let me guess: Many scenes full of Sony product placement, racist jokes, humor based on the weight of Melissa McCarthy, stereotypes of NY City and silly references to the original...the Honest Trailer will be gold.."
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,I thought this trailer was a joke. I am very disappointed that it was not. I agree 100% with Maddox's review of the trailer. Fuck Hollywood for totally and unnecessarily ruining yet another classic movie.
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"Think this is mainly made for women, its a chick flick. Ghostbusters was mainly aimed at boys when we were kids with the cartoon, toys etc. Wonder what all the women would say to a My Little Pony movie with action and guns blazing aimed for a more male audience."
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,The problem not just with this movie but with comedies in general is that the jokes are being thrown right in your face so that stupid people don't miss them. The humor in Star Wars and the Avengers is closer to the humor in the original ghostbusters than this shit pile will probably end up being.

mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,Ghostbusters (2016) looks terrible and unfunny. You can tell that the Screen Junkies were struggling to find good things to say about it. I will not be going to see this movie.
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"My argument about this whole thing is that they could have made a film similar to this - but leave Ghostbusters alone. Copy it, reference it, but not reboot it.
Ghostbusters 3, with oscar grown up and ghosts somehow making a return and he has to gather a new team to try and stop the ghosts, with help from some previous ghostbusters members (cameos etc) would have been great.
This remake has literally flipped the whole things upside down, this will not spawn a cartoon series for kids of today, kids of today will not want to see a sequel of this or a crappy ghostbusters game with forgettable characters (or only memorable from roles played previously in other fieg films).
Ghostbusters was epic and exciting and humour and wit linked it together.

This film will be supported by a mainly female fan base, which is fine, but unfortunately this film is not for fans, its not for kids, it's just out there to make Sony some money for their Ghostbusters ""franchise"" with as many cheap jokes and forgettable scenes as possible. 

They had a chance to really pull ghostbusters up, blow the dust off and make it shine for todays generation. But what they have done is make a PG13 Spy film with a ghostbusters dub step song..."

mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,What is with the one minute break in the very beginning???
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"This is shit. You can tell that the bearded guy thinks it's shit. People are so afraid to say the obvious. Everything that they liked about the trailer has little to nothing to do with the writing. Yes, the ghosts look cool. The jokes aren't funny, they are predictable, sterile, and boring attempts at humor.

Women deserve better than this and fans deserve better than this. If this trailer is any indication of what this film will become, it may be successful but it will be damaging. This is another shit attempt of the SJW cohesion into the industry. 

While I am no SJW, this shit is pretty funny: 

Everyone is a female scientist except for the black chick, which I have no qualms about. However, she is a completely accurate representation of a ""mammy"".

       ""YALL GUUD WITH THA SCIENCES BUT LAWD I KNO NEW YOLK AN GOT U SUM ICE COLD LEMONADE COMIN OUT!""

 Lol, for fuck's sake. If you're going to have ""contemporary values"" at least be consistent right? Yeah, ""Winston wasn't a scientist"". I know, but Winton's appeal (in the film) was that he was a regular dude who walked into a crazy adventure and had to adapt. Great job sony."

mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"The thing is Andy, you say it's more appealing to kids and there are too many slime gags. Go back and watch the original first movie and it is definitely a 'pg-13 family movie' with a lot of slime gags. I think this is trying to introduce ghostbusters to a new audience, rather than just for the fanboys."
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,I just really hope the next trailer is better.
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,Leslie Jones and Kate Mckinnon had the really good lines and some of those weren't even great.

Bridesmaids was good, The Heat was not, Spy was great. 2 out of 3 doesn't deserve this kind of faith, especially as the best parts of the 2 good ones 'required' the R Rating.

Watch out below folks - these comments are super duper mega cool and people really like the movie so on so forth, I'm actually lying."
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"My initial thoughts that I wrote on the trailer:

The minor musical notes at the beginning give me memories of 'Jurassic World'. Please let this not be another one of those.
""Someone is creating a device that amplifies paranormal activity"" also makes me think it might try to be convoluted with science as opposed to just leaving it at 'ghosts exist'.

But other than those potential problems, yeah, it looks awesome. I look forward to it.

Thoughts on this:
It made me laugh that Dan thought the same thing about 'Jurassic World'.
I get what Andy's saying about the pacing. I don't dislike the humour as such but some of it does feel forced and a bit over-the-top (I don't particularly like Leslie Jones' character from what I've seen).
I agree with Erin about it being a waste of time to tie it in to the past films. I don't need to see 'Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull' or 'A Good Day to Die Hard' torch passing.
I did get a sense that it might be spooky but I definitely would like to see it be more spooky than the trailer suggested. On a relevant note, I haven't seen it but I hear the recent 'Goosebumps' film did well to be a kids film but spooky.
I definitely agree about not needing that finale scene in the trailer. It could have easily stopped before that."

mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"The trailer was pretty bad. Gave a lot away like McCarthy being possesed. And oh boy the cliches... Im the smart one, im the techy one, im the street smart one, and im the annoying fat one"
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,It's not the worst trailer for a movie I've ever seen. But my low expectations were not met.
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"just my opinion, i have no problem with an all female team but only if it was continued from the original. i don't really like the fact they are going in a more different approach for the reboot"
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"This movie will be total, and complete shit.  Just saying"
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,it' was shitty to be honest I'm not it's same Melissa McCartney from other movies im feel its Shitty I'm sticking with the old Ghostbusters!
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,So the only think I like about it is the new ghosts. This looks more like a comedy with ghostbusters thrown in as an after thought.
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"Wanna do the Original movie justice? 


Don't make a reboot. Dont make a sequel. Let it be."
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"Looked naff. A pointless remake, like
Total recall & Point Break. Not even funny, childish humour really. I don't like how they are having a female cast for the sake of trying to be modern & feminist."

mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"To me this is just all effects and a bad script OR weak script. I don´t enjoy Paul F. work, it´s fine but just like that so...i don´t know i didn´t like this. It´s my opinion"

mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,Stop saying they are gimped because they have to live up to the original... they did that to themselves... thats like a man cutting off his own leg because he thinks its trendy and us feeling sorry for him... they wanted to make this movie... any struggle they have is of their own making
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,I haven't seen any ghost busters so I'll see this one and then see the older one so that way I'll see how good the original one compared to the new one

mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"I'm don't looking forward to the movie, and it's not because the characters are female. I still wouldn't look forward to it, if the characters were male."

I am sure kids of today have an idea of who the Ghostbusters are...that doesnt excuse this trailer and film"
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"So it's basically: Two Scientists, The Crazy One, and The Black one."

mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,Finebros gonna hunt u down and decapitate u now
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"Why do Americans start their clips with ""What's up everybody?"" or in this case ""What's goin on everbody?""  ?
Can't you guys just say 'Hello'?
It's so cliched and irritating the way you people do this stuff.
And the film looks dire!"
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,This makes the Angry Birds movie look Oscar worthy.
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"I don't get what their beef is with ""I hope it's not aimed at PG13""....did we not all watch the originals when we were kids?"
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,The movie looks like shit.
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"I love how they had zero reaction to anything except for nostagia. ""Oh slimmer""
But all that other crap, nothing."
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,Honestly it looks so lame... And I feel like it showed 80% of the film
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,This crap makes Scooby-doo look like the Shining.
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,Trailer looks miserable.
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,you guys really need to think of an original idea.
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"1.  All the actors doing their same bit they've done a million times

2. Proton packs now in any form you want....double pistols, proton brass knuckles, WTF

3. You're the smartest scientist, you're the toughest ninja, you're the coolest New Yorker, cookie cutter intro.

4. Not the best 1st impression, but not ruling it out.....yet"
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,You guys seemed so afraid to criticize it
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,#when Morgan Freeman is the best part of the Ghostbusters trailer
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"I think the trailer included unnecessary exposition (i.e. ""Holtzman, you're a brilliant engineer."" and ""Erin, no one is better at quantum physics more than you."" and ""You guys are really smart about this science stuff, but I know New York."").  Might as well wear name tags that say ""Venkman-type"", ""Stantz-type"", ""Spengler-type"", and ""Winston-type"".  Also, is any contemporary movie exempt from the dubstep/EDM score?"
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,it reminds me of Scooby-Doo movies
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,they ruined the film and franchise
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,But will everyone's favorite ghost come back? Don't make me go into details
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"Ghostbusters was an adventure movie that had funny actors and elements to make a great movie. This new movie looks like it's being shoehorned with lots of ""jokes"". It's a comedy with ghosts. That is why it will never be comparable to the original two. I won't be wasting my time or money on it. The trailer is at 26k likes to 37k dislikes currently."
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"The trailer is shit, Dan is always annoying."
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,The best humor of the original film was deadpan and even subtle. This seems more broad and slapstick.
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,THIS VT WILL NOT WORK FIX IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,I can't believe people hate this trailer I really liked it definitely going to see it
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"3:55 Throwing up ectoplasma is NOT funny! I hope there won't be any more of such childish humor in the movie!

Throwing up, farting, shitting, being drunk are BAD movie elements, and it should be written into the screenwriter's bible, that this is just Kindergarten humor and therefore forbidden!"
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,If that trailer shows the best of the movie then I'm concerned.
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,0:55
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"Yeah the visuals looked good and all but I got a ""Nickelodeon"" vibe from this trailer and if that turns out to be the case then ouch, this movie will blow for the franchise it's trying to tap into."
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,I saw the original 3 times in the theater that summer. Now get off my lawn you young kids!
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"I asked myself multiple questions about the integrity of Screen Junkies while watching this. Why are we watching the full trailer with them, when normally they can only show clips of things? Does that mean they got permission to make this video, as an advertising promo for the movie? Did they get payed, or agree to not paint the trailer in too poor a light? Why did the poll they mentioned have a spot for really liking it, but not for really hating it (especially when the trailer itself is 60% or so negative thumbs)? Why did Dan and Andy have a look of disgust while watching the trailer, but acted like they didn't have a problem with it afterwards. The only person I thought was being honest, was Erin, because she was harshest to the trailer, even though I don't think she was offended by it as much by the look on her face while watching it.  Shame on you Screen Junkies.....Shame."
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,I hope they don't try to recreate the original movie completely
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,I didn't need to see the trailer the one image i saw was all i need to see it was crap like the look of the Joker in suicide squad.
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,This movies gonna blow
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,Dan should go to more red carpets!
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,Hal probably feels really dumb now realizing its a SEQUEL.
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"""Four scientists saved New York?"" I don't want to cry FAIL immediately, but come on--at least know your source material! Winston was in no way a scientist. He was hired help.

Anyway, the humor (if you could call it that) here was a red flag to me. I didn't even crack a smile once. ""That's gonna leave a mark""? Seriously? Wow. Seemed flat. Characters seem stale. The look of the movie was on point, and the tone overall might be good--but I seriously hope they have funnier material and better chemistry in the full film."
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"rip Egon Spengler, and rip Ghostbusters... i wonder wasn't there even one person in the production team saying what the hell is this? for some reason brought ""The Room"" in mind"
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,i hate possession and mind control in movies. it feels tedious and repetitive. joss whedon knew that in marvels the avengers when he did the tony stark mind control gag.
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"It looks like a direct-to-DVD film.

And the Melissa McCarthy possession scene is horrible."
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,They screwed up the original story right from start. There weren't 4 scientists. There were 3. Winston wasn't a scientist.
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,can't say anything bad about it because it would be sexist. perfect cover.
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,its interesting how all four are desperately trying to avoid saying its shit.
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"PLEASE have more of these reactions, and have MORE ERIN on as well.  Erin breaks up the sausage fest in a very good way."
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,they seem scared to say that it sucks
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,It will suck. Damn. I am so sad...
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,WEAK PC REMAKE. That is all.
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,The whole Reboot or Sequel thing is really confusing at this point and could kill the movie if they don't have a great explanation for it!

mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"So the ghosts look li,e they're copied from the PS3/360 game and the possessors and ""amplifying energy"" business is lifted from the game's story as well. The dialog is forced exposition especially since the original never really needed to have the characters state each other's defining qualities like ""you're the best something or other"" and ""you're a this or that"" to spell out the characters. The new weapons are taking the Kenner route of merchandising the shit out of this thing."
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,its Scooby doo 4 . it looks empty between the actors
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"I'm torn and agree with the SJ crew for the most part. The humor felt forced, but I didn't hate this trailer at all."

mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"Holy fuck.  I was so excited for this...and man did it not deliver.  Total fail of a trailer.  Mcarthy and Wiig playing the same characters they always play.  What happened here?  This is a great cast and great director, and the trailer to quote harloff ""STOINKS"".  The dialogue, cgi, jokes all fell flat. Seriously what happened?"
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"It's probably just me, but after seeing the trailer I feel this is going to be the Pixles of 2016."
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,I was very excited about the all female cast aspect but this comedic tone is a total miss for me based on the trailer.  I don't think I'll go see it.

mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"Notice them all trying so hard to be diplomatic...that stilted awkwardness with zero joy or true enthusiasm.
Yeah you can tell they think it looks like shit...they're just too politically correct to say it.

This is the problem nowadays...instead of a movie starting off with a good idea or a novel weird twist on the traditional interpretation it starts with a stupid social agenda...which some silly people will be hesitant to criticise for fear of being called out with silly names and labels.
reboots and remakes typically suck ass, miss the point or fail to capture the greatness of the original...having a all female cast doesn't change this fact...yes there are exceptions to the rule but come on lets be honest...this looks like garbage."
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,It looks better than Pixels but so did the turd i flushed last night.
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"When I saw the black chick, the obvious thing was that she's replacing Ernie Hudson, but thinking now it was that the GB's were just hiring someone because of the excess labor which could've been any Joe Everyman to round them out. Here they're really playing it up that she's ""street smart"" because she knows the subway system which is apparently her one viable skill. They could've easily squeezed in something like.... I'm an ex-cop, fire fighter or something where she has a wider skill set to aid them with on field stuff. Now it's 3 scientists and a ticket agent battling demonic forces."
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,Why is Andy always talking about Felicity Jones? She is definitely not in the movie. She's in Rogue One.
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,I thought Melissa McCarthy was playing Slimer

mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,I rather go blind then watch this horseshit movie.
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,lol... can't wait for drama because only black lady in this movie is walking stereotype.
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"I actually feel these guys were too nice. 
I love how they are like the black woman is ""LOUD""

She was not loud... She was a ridiculous Black stereotype!!!

I hated almost everything in this trailer and I'm not upset about the all woman thing. 
I wanted expensive CGI. I wanted hyper realistic ghosts. They look cheezy as fuck. Every one was so much harder on the point break trailer. 

I see this turning into Dracula. But more racist....so racist Dracula... 


PS
Force Awakens did not satisfy me. Except for Black Guy in star wars (I need to learn people's names.) He was amazing. SO AMAZING,  
PPS. Looking forwards to Forrest Wittaker from Rogue! Fuck yeah! 
PPPS. Morgan Freeman Fuck Yeah! (I'm so jealous)"

Or I may like it, but I could never like it in the same way I love the originals."
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,I think it looks funny.
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,Well it's not bad.
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,*BOO!* ... Goes the audience.
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"I was hyped for Olympus Has Fallen due to the cast although I found it boring as hell. For all the cool action there was too much politics while I'd happily not watch Aaron Eckhart in anything for the rest of my life. By comparison I was surprised by how much I preferred White House Down. Yes technically it's not the best film out there and like every other Roland Emmerich movie it's made for the lowest common denominator. But it was fun, didn't take itself too seriously, while I laughed all the way through. And unlike Olympus Has Fallen I can actually remember who the bad guys were."
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"Dude, beard guy, you're complaining about a character being loud but you're over here yelling and talking over the others. Don't act like Donald Drumpf man, it is super annoying."
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"I'll agree that the visual elements look fine. The ghosts look fine. The new Proton Packs look fine. Ecto 1 looks fine. Etc.
Problem is everything else. It doesn't look terribly funny. It doesn't look particularly spooky.
Overall, it just looks like another underwhelming reboot of a movie that didn't need a reboot in the first place.
Hopefully I'm wrong and the movie winds up being good, but that's what I got from this trailer."
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,BOYCOTT.
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"There is a line where ""nods"" turn into ""shameless ripoffs"".

mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"I thought the trailer was alright and I am still going to go as a reviewer and fan of the original ghostbusters.  Though it may have nostalgia attached to it, I won't let that alter my score when I review it."
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,Even if it was an all male cast... it STILL looks doesn't came across as funny at all.
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"I love watching their reaction during the trailer. No laughs. The realisation of their dreams coming to an end on their faces. That awkward silence half way through the interview where Andy just forces a laugh to break the sad silence. Dan in the corner, the quietest I've seen him... sad times"
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,Id rather watch Bob Hoskins in Mario Broa than this unfunny shite

mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,The official trailer on youtube has more dislikes than likes. Not good. The Point Break remake trailer had a better like to dislike ratio.
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,We don't need a lame waterdown Ghostbusters.
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,Only complaints I have at this point are pretty much visual.  It looks kind of cartoony.  Way bright and goofy. You can tell this movie is going to be geared toward toy sales.

mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,My first reaction when I watched the trailer was: KILL IT WITH FIRE!!!
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,I agree completely with Dan.
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,The trailer was terrible. The whole jokes and shit were terrible and the CGI was awful. After this trailer I have no real hopes for the movie at all.
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"The Ghostbusters trailer.....a disappointment! I liked the beginning (I hope that it is a sequel and not a reboot) but when the ""Ghostbusters"" stood in a library, studying the ""Library ghost wanna-be"", the trailer lost me :-( It didn't feel like Ghostbusters. It feels like they're trying too hard to be cool and funny but in the end, this trailer wasn't cool or funny. Also, why is there so much slime? Basically the whole second Ghostbusters movie was about this weird, pink goo/slime but there was a reason for it too be there and there was some slime in the first movie as well for some funny scenes, but now it feels like they're thinking ""let's just throw slime everywhere and make every ghost slimey...because...you know...they're ghosts!"" That's stupid! 
 And why does this trailer feel like a big light show? Every single ghost is surrounded by mystical, green, blue or pink smoke and the scene near the end of the trailer when the ""Ghostbusters"" are surrounded by an army of ghosts and there's all these weird lightning and smoke......and what the heck is that!.........a giant, tall ghost in a fancy costume walking past them like it was nothing! WHAT IS THAT!? The Stay Puft Marshmallow Man was silly...in a good way that made sence, but now ""Let's just throw a bunch of weird stuff in there and people will love it!"" NOT TRUE!!! 
Also, are these ""Ghostbusters"" supposed to be sccientists? Because they didn't look and feel like scientists to me!
  I liked the ending though when Melissa Mcarthy (I think that that's her name) get's possesed! It looked cool but unfortinatly..... it was a kind of big SPOILER!

And I thouht that I would try to write a short comment! I will still see the new Ghostbusters movie at the cinema though, and this was after all just a trailer (lucky for us!) Hope that the actull movie is good though :-) 
And I also didn't think that the trailer was completely garbage! So I still have hope :-D"
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"I found the ""it's a Cadillac"" line funny as well,  when Tony Montana said it."
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,this trailer feels uninspired. i hope the full movie doesn't reflect this.
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"in the background when you were talking about the ghost's and how they look there is a Twinkie billboard that says ""that's a big Twinkie"". so big nod there."

mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"Screen Junkies are losing some of their credibility here. For shilling London has Fallen of course. They also are being far too kind to the trailer. The CGI in particular is part of the reason the ghosts do not seem spooky at all. Usually Dan goes off about films, Jurassic World and even to an extent The Force Awakens, for using all CGI yet here he seems oddly positive about it."
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,00:57 for the way...
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"meh

Not like this was a massive love for me or anything in its original run but i actually wonder if this even works today... whether its male or female i just think the ghost thing is a little played out now from all over the years tbh and this is too mellow now for the genre, nothing to do with the female actors at all imo - its a comedy with ghosts - probably would have worked better if it was more serious dark horror comedy in this day and age but it looks like a tepid comedy with ghosts, not worth hype or hating on... just bleh..."
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,The trailer is very Drumpf.

mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,As a fan of the original and sequel this movie trailer didn't get a chuckle out of me. It looked terrible and unfunny.  Might watch it to see the original Ghostbusters in it and that is it.

mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"Really want this movie to do great, but the only thing that looked good was the ghost. everything seemed to be just what youd expect in a comedy. what made it confussing was I wasn't digging it, but the music made it good. take away the music. would the trailer be that great. the first one with had that scare in the library, this one had the ghost throw up on her. so its going to be more for kids/teens/some adults...but yeah hopefully they do great."
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"The first Ghostbusters movie was pretty scary. Yeah I said it ""scary"" for a kid watching back then.....back then the special effects was like the poltergeist movies which were scary as fuck back then. It was funny and scary. This movie just looks like a Saturday morning cartoon show."

mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,Never liked Melissa McCarthy before not gonna start liking her now. Trailer looks weirdly put together and the jokes are just not working for my me. Hopefully it's better than what they put out in the trailer. But I was worried before seeing the trailer and that worry is still there.
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"Oh I've seen on the guys faces, they were so much afraid to say what they really thought about the trailer :) Then Erin shot on the trailer, they began to agree :D"

mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,Rotten Tomatoes says that the original cast are playing their ghostbuster characters not someone new.
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,I'm not sold by the trailer but I hope it proves me wrong because it's a good cast (even though there are some questions over it) and we don't end up with another Fant4stic.
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,Looks like a shit b movie tbh 😕

mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"It should be a sequel and included the original cast as extended cameos (the ones still alive).

mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,This is exactly what I thought it would be. Bridesmaids with Proton Packs. A better trailer would have been just two minutes of Paul Fieg giving the viewer the middle finger and molesting a Stay Puft Marshmallow Man action figure.
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,Looks like a big flop
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,Millennials? Really? You think a 10 and 12 year olds are millennials? You do know that the millennial generation goes from 1980 to 2000 right? Sorry but millennials grew up with the original. This movie for generation z.
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"I've never seen the original movie (pls, don't kill me). 
This new trailer doesn't get me into it... like at all. It looks like such a forced-funny movie, you know what I mean? Something like Tammy or so. And I don't think the original movie was aimed at that category - but maybe I'm totally wrong here.

Man I am so absolutely not excited for it. Or as Dan put it: ""Ehhh yay."""

mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,I can't believe that Leslie Jones thought basing her character/performance on 'Mammy Two shoes' from Tom and Jerry would be a good idea.
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"Leslie Jones should have been Queen Latifah. And the character should have been the straight one amongst the kooky scientists. 
Queen Latifah can do the straight character. Look at her in Stranger Than Fiction. 
Winston was always the most normal of the OG Ghostbusters. 
His female counterpart is the most cliché of the group. 
That's kind of a shame. 
Leslie Jones could've played a side role if they wanted to hook up their SNL pal. Oh well."

Fuller House much more fun as a sequel, ghostbusters shoulda shown the old guys passing the torch to the next gen, this says 'wipe away the old & regurgitate & take credit for what the classics did' i'll watch it on Netflix in 2 years"
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"Everyone seems to be following the hate train ""oh, all female cast, ewww"" and ""it's not gonna suck"", you can't base a 2 hour film on a 3minute trailer, everyone will see this at some point and I hope it'll do well. Do I think it's going to be amazing, a laugh out loud film, no, do I think it's going to be an awful movie no, but I can't base a small 3 minute trailer on a god damn Ghostbusters in 2016. The effects look amazing for slimmer and the liberian and the scene in Times Square, the technology looks modern like the proton packs or the bare trap looking thing (presumably a ghost trap). I do agree with the humour being a bit childish, and just being the actors charceters, being loud. But who doesn't want a new ghostbusters film."

This movie looks great."
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"The problem is the lack of subtlety. 
In the original we didn't actually see peter get slimed, only the aftermath. In this movie it is a full on nickelodeon kids awards show.
The possession scene would be better if we didn't see the ghost straight up jump into her face. In the original we didn't see dana or louis get possessed. They were attacked and then dragged off screen.
To show the characters are smart they just show them writing equations on a chalk board. Like ""SEE ME SMART"". In the original they showed their intelligence through dialogue. Even Peter showed how smart he was by manipulating everyone and with all the quick quips."
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,im 20 and LOVE LOVE the original movie and also the second and the whole franchise I was worried but after seeing the trailer im pretty optimistic it looks like they nailed the look of the universe and the style of the technology slimer and the reat of the ghosts look pretty amazing as for the humor I watch SNL and they are very funny people I love Kate McKinnon the most out of the SNL cast at the moment and I feel like she's gonna be really funny even if she didn't do much in the trailer its not supposed to be better than the original it just needs to be good on its own and for me it looks like a lot of fun

Yup not gona be wasting my money on this crap."
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,The female cast isn't the problem. The problem is that Ghostbusters doesn't need to be remade.
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,Gotta be honest it seems like what they did what they did with force awakens with hitting the same plot points of the original and I really don't care for an EDM version of the GB theme I'll give it a watch . But honestly I kinda got a  big loada Meh from it ..
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"Major major MAJOR ""eh"". 
A bit too reliant on SFX, stereotypical characters (very classless), characters seem WAY too over animated and it felt like it was trying way way too hard. 

The energy felt forced, and the comedy seems way too modern (as in its not timeless like the original movies, it'll expire after a few years).

It's funny because people want to talk about how racism was so much worse a few decades ago, yet they didn't treat Winston like the token black guy, yet they did with the woman here.
One last thing, the human possession thing seems really really stupid."

mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"Y'know I like the actresses in it who are originally known from SNL, but honestly since then they've starred in some, though somewhat amusing, dry films. Awkward, trying a bit too hard, etc. Seems like a Ghostbusters version of Bridesmaids, which isn't what Ghostbusters is. They should've made an original kind of movie rather than just a different version of the same thing. And I do agree with some others who are disappointed that the only black femal lead is stereotyped. To me, if you're going to make a character a stereotype, don't have them as the lead or comical relief, because it's 2016 and we should find things more humorous than this. It'll be maybe another 5 or 6 out of 10 to me, though I feel others will give it more credit than it deserves."
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"How... _HOW_ in the _Hell_ did Dan Murrell _not_ hate this steaming pile of footage?

The effects, the characters (the quirky mad scientist who hears quirky goggles all day, or the manly-looking tough black New York chick who is just loud), the humor... I mean, it all feels like this is set in the Haunted Mansion universe with Eddie Murphy.  And proton-pack pistols?  Double wielding at that?  Really?"
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,movie is going to be a failure by the looks of it its like editing the history books replacing it with someone else.
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,I'm glad I can ignore this movie forever
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,It felt a little better watching it a second time...

mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"""But I know New York."" whaaaaaaaaaaatttttttt"
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,anyone noticed how they pretty much reacted to the only reference to the source material (like flubber) and they didn't to pretty much all the action and the humor?
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"I think the original movies aren't trying to hard to be funny and did well with it, and this one definitely is trying way to hard to be funny and not doing to well with it."
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"I said it elsewhere but I want to say it here as well.  I was ok with everything until the Hat/Hair joke, then the trailer Crystal skulled for me and everything landed flat.  the proton pistols and knuckles.  I really didn't like what was teased with the Possessions."
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"I thought it looked pretty good, other than Leslie Jones playing the same stereotypical character she's always playing on SNL. At least she got a chuckle out of me towards the end of the trailer."
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"This is what happens when people try to appease SJW shrieking by giving them their way. A hollowed out, unfunny shell of what was an iconic movie.

""Please, don't be offended, this character is such a genius engineer that we explicitly have to state it! The other one is the BEST at quantum physics, because that has things to do with Ghostbusters! She's smart alright. And empowered!""

Since they're never satisfied, they will now complain the black character is racist for saying aww hell no and talking about the devil. At least Jeb Bush will be employed for a while, they can parade him around movie theaters with a sign that says ""Please laugh""."
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,There is no reboot....There is only ZUUL!
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,My god i´m in love with Erin Robinson
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"This will bomb hard. Why they are doing reboot while not saying it is a reboot? All ghosts are repeats ( at least 80% from that trailer), there was nothing funny in there, those women seems to be forced to be funny. Plus theirs equipment? It looks far worse than in originals and those were not so good too. Please stay away from good brands. Stick to those already destroyed like, idk, Transformers."
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"The hatred for this is crazy. The original Ghostbusters is great, no doubt about it. The second meh..... Paul Feig is a solid comedic director, Bridesmaids and Spy are very funny. The Heat isn't too bad either. The cast is good, Wiig is always funny, McCarthy works best with Feig. The other two I don't know much about, SNL not shown in the UK...But it's nice to see refreshing faces. Overall it looks good, could be just as good as the first Ghostbusters. If not then we have another Ghostbusters 2."
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"Didn't see anything super terrible, but nothing good enough for me to actually watch it"
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,Paul Fuig the benefit ? Why he just rides on the coat tales of shitty Melissa Mcarthy jokes and easy to please fans
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"This is why it's going to fail and am hearing a lot the jokes, the jokes, the jokes when was ghost busters a comedy, it had adult humour and scary ghosts and serious side this trailer and movie looks a joke seriously this debate and poeple deserve a slap with the arguments. This is what I thought would happen with a female cast... Tampon packs ready!"
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,Sued?
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,It looks like another scooby-doo movie. Period.

mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,Andy just summed up my entire problem with the movie and what I originally wanted.
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,Looks friggen terrible.
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,looks mediocre at best....
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,CGI ghosts look terrible.
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,for now there are no tampons joke

mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"This movie has ""straight to redbox"" written all over it."
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,This trailer just made my fears more realistic. I'm not having high hopes for this.
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,Paul Feig does not make quality films. And Ghostbusters purists will be upset.
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,Dan didn't see any red flags in the trailer? How about the complete lack of comedy and how about the joke of a stereotype that Leslie Jones is playing?
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"it felt like an Adam Sandler movie, which makes me very sad"
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,It looks like a Scooby Doo fan fiction movie. No thanks
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,Awful.
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,This is their first reaction video? Yikes guys
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"For some reason this trailer does not makes me want to watch the movie, but instead I feel like I should call Weight Watchers, weird."
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"No reactions except pointing out obvious things ""music, slimer, hemsworth"" and barely chuckle at the jokes. I feel bad for people who are still expecting a competent movie."
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,Looks good; I love these ladies.
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"I have been subbed from the beginning and I think I'm coming to a realization. Are all these people assholes? Vapid, LA talking assholes? 

I may need to do more research but I'm fairly sure these people talk and say very little."
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,I just hope Ivan Reitman gets so upset with this mess that he decides to make Ghostbusters 3
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"I've seen the trailer and my reaction is. If theirs something strange and it don't look good what could it be THIS TRAILER. This looks so bad. I would rather watch a 3 hour video of a waterfall whilst desperstly needing to go to toilet the whole time, than watch this film."
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,I've asked on a couple of videos. And haven't gotten a good answer yet. Can anyone here give me a good legitimate reason to not be excited about this movie.
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"Looks like a total fail to me. The trailer was as funny as syphilis. The effects were crap. I can't wait to see this bomb.


It seems to me like almost all the youtube reviews are afraid to be critical of an all-female reboot, as they'll get called mysoginists, but unfunny is unfunny. They need tyo grow the balls to call it as it is."
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,Where is Gerard Butler's Scottish accent?
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,Movie looks like shit
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,Meeting the original's standards is going to be a near impossible task(99 percent of remakes always suck). I expect a sub-par movie from what the trailer show but it might surprise.
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,Skip it
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,I thought the ghosts looked like the ones in Scooby-Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,I think the movies will be connected. I really do think the original cast will be replaying their original characters as well. I love the look of this...I've been a Ghostbusters fan since I can walk. The original coming out when I was 3...so yeah...can't wait!
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,love the intro
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"The original Ghostbusters was PG. If Feig can't bring charm in PG or PG13, then that's a shame."
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,The movie sounds like it would be more interesting if it was a sequel to the original film. But as a reboot its just... meh.
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,this movie looks terrible jesus christ
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,Lot of hate here.... I think it looked good.
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"11 min in, have to stop and say this, 10:35 does that look convincing to anyone? :D 
He MUST be getting paid to not bash this movie...and I´m suspicious of the rest of you too!!!"
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,It's not slime.  It's ectoplasma
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"Looks like an SNL parody, just with a bigger budget"
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"I didn't even crack a smile. It looks so bad... and also, why is the only black character in the movie the ""I act manly but I am a woman so it is funny"" and the only ""non-scientist""? So having a stereotypical black character is completely OK, but having a all male team is a no go? So being racist is OK, as long as you are not ""sexist"" nobody is going to say anything? What the hell!"
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,all this does is make me wanna watch the original.
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"Well, everyone is saying it's gonna suck... Maybe it could be good?"
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"Looked as bad as I thought it would be with the cast that's in it. I may get it when Redbox has it for a $1, otherwise I'm holding onto my money."
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,that looks really depressing
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"i wanted this to be great. I really wanted to see the ""should have been male"" fans proven wrong. but this looks awful"
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,hal has the worst breathing
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"SFX aside, I thought this movie looked REALLY weak."
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"It looks really nice in terms of props, design and CGI. But if only that would make a good movie, more people would have liked Spectre."
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,Looks like a disaster.
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,JUST DO V FOR VENDETTA HONEST TRAILER FOR THE LOVE OF GOD!!!
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,I ain't afraid of no ghost but this sequel scares the shit outta me!

mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"There's still a chance it turns out good, but that chance gets smaller every day."
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"So they are still doing the token black character in these movies?  There are plenty of black scientists, why does she have to be the loud mouth black woman who is from the streets?"
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,No.
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,would you guys consider doing an honest trailer for  deadpool?
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"""Slimer!""
""Helmsworth.""

Pretty much all you need to know."
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,Like if you want more of LIVE screen junkies
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"before watching, I'm calling it; Hal will say it's good only because he like Anita Sarkeesian"
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"Just like with Trump, garbage that media and massive outlets want to sell us, is best left ignored."
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,Who you gonna call..... A better cast
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,please guys but really it's an another RIPD shit
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,it looks like shit
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,Why does Paul Feig get the benefit of the doubt?  He made 1 or 2 funny movies depending on who you ask.
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,cant wait for ghostbusters 😁
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,Looks terrible. Who wants to see these middle aged women trying very hard to be funny? New movies suck. The new star wars movie sucked. It is getting worse and worse every year.
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"Well, Mckinnon looks like she'll be a hoot to watch. Other than her part, the movie looks kinda meh. Also, black person reduced to driver? Did Q5 advise this?"
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,I dont find the trailer bad. Its not good but not bad too. Its like a 5/10.
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,The movie looks like a bad Seth roger movie and I like Seth Rogen.
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,This Ghostbusters trailer is awful and is going to be another carbon copy of all these actors shit characters. Leslie Jones playing Leslie Jones and Melissa McCarthy playing Melissa McCarthy.
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,You'd need only look at the subdued reactions to know this wasn't a great trailer and it really fell flat for me personally. Nothing presented here is making me doubt my assumptions about it being yet another mediocre 80's remake.
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"It looks like fun, I'll probably see it."
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"Wow .... all female cast ..... way to screw up Ghostbusters.

Original movie trailer: Spooky and witty

This: Loud, obnoxious and kidfriendly.

Definately a pass for me!"
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"the groan means "" I Liked it, but if I say that my credibility is fucked"""
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,if they want make it spooky they should make the trailer kinda horror movie style i think that might be appeal for ghostbusters and make people not expect it... like how extreme ghostbusters... animated series...
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"Haha, you looked like you ate something bad when you saw it:)"
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,well... this looks horrible...
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,I'm not interested.  Probably see it with the other half if she pays for it.
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"i get that its targeted for a new generation, but it looks terrible."
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,I think it was too much adding in the goast taking over her body
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,Ghosts in the original looked way better.
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"Who you gonna call?

The Garbage truck, so they can take this movie away too the dump!"
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,The trailer was shit
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,....i think the ghosts look cool ... and...err Slimer is in it :D...:/
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"My son is 5, he watched ""original ghostbusters"" front to back a year ago, so saying that ""teenagers"" today are not familiar with ghostbusters like ""you and I"" is a bit... Arrogant."
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"Can't help it, but this looks like fans made it XD The effects are well done, but it doesn't look like a real movie."
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,After looking at this new Ghostbusters movie..as a big fan..all I can say is..I'M DONE!!!!
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,I cant take this movie serious since i know the original.
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"After all these great superhero movies, it's good to see Hollywood can still pump out crap when they need to."
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"That trailer was incredibly ""meh"". Leslie Jones just doesn't feel like she belongs in there. Everyone else is fine. Not great but fine. LJ is why I wont be watching this in theaters."
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,Totally fun watching 1/6 of your reaction!
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,Winston wasn't a scientist. He was the everyday man. The average joe.
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,i just see how slimer will look like with modern day effects
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"7:04 You can see the one woman in the group giving permission not to like it, and suddenly the floodgates open."
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,They said the design for the ghosts looked good but I personally thought the cgi looked bad for today's standards
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,Why Isn't there honest trailer this week?
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"I take issue with a couple of those criticisms.  

Original Ghostbusters was a fun movie, but not really all that funny.  Many quotable lines, entertaining fun situations, but you don't laugh at it like you would an out right comedy.  

And getting upset for Leslie playing something close to her typical but also getting upset at Wiig for branching out - you can have one of those, not both."
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"It was awful the ghosts looked way too CGI, It looked like a SNL Sketch lol"
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"As a trailer it is awful. Terrible editing with a complete lack of excitement. It hasn't turned me off the film though, it hasn't done anything to make me really want to see it either. Leslie Jones' character doesn't look to promising and I want to see more of Kate McKinnon's character because she looks from the fee brief moments she's in the trailer to be slightly more of an original character than the other three leads.

Also, I'm pretty sure it's a sequel and not a reboot. Not only because of the text at the start but because according to Imdb Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Earnie Hudson and Sigourney Weaver are all in it."
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,fuck it I'm being honest they just threw my child hood acrost the room
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,Why is it that every shitty trailer I have seen comes from Sony. Remember in TASM2 when they showed the last 2 seconds of the movie in the trailer and that made you think that there was more after Spider-Man swinging with a manhole cover but there wasn't. :)
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"This ""reboot"" is going to be so bad, I feel bad for the current generations who will experience Ghostbusters for the first time and see this monstrosity : /"
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"I can't believe they actually thought that the cast, script and overall direction for Ghostbusters was a great idea.  It's an abortion of film making."
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"This trailer felt like an unfunny rehash. Why this is a reboot I I have no idea, but it feels stale."
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"If anyone criticises this film, feminists will lose their shit"
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"I think this is the worst kind of trailer there is, not that the movie is gonna be bad or anything for that we'll just have to wait and see. No i'm talking about the trailer, IT DIDN'T DO IT'S JOB, i got absolutely no reaction from it, maybe the movie is good but my god trailer sucked, adding to that it wasn't horribly bad that it was enjoyable it was just ""Ehhh"""
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"I would challenge Dan to a movie fight, but I know they don't do fan requests."
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"this movie looks funny , I'm excited !"
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,Are the Fine Bros still funny?
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,Is there a word in screenwriting for sprinkling random unrelated jokes into a story?  That looks like what's happening here.  Someone wrote a serious story and someone else went in and penciled in a bunch of jokes to kinda pry a comedy in.
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,starts 0:54
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,im sorry but this looks horrible 😂😂😂😂😒
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"I am a millennium kid but I am in the hardcore fan target audience, not the kid target audience"
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,so basically similar but with women
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,I wish the screen junkies would just say what they really think....the movie just looks awful. We all know it. It just looks plain bad.
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,Somethings feels off.  I don't know what it is.  But it feels odd.
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,I hated it.
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,Not a fan of Paul Feig movies at all. I haven't seen Spy( which I heard wasn't bad) but I really can't bear Melissa McCarthy and her awful acting
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"I have been watching you guys for over 2 years, take off the kid gloves!! Tell it like it is!!"
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,This trailer failed to impress or interest me. It looks really dumb.
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,I'm gonna call the Suicide Squad !!
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"The new Ghostbusters looks awful. And im not even a fan of the original Ghostbusters so this is a completely unbiased opinion. Awful acting, awful lines, awful comedy. Usually Wiig would carry a movie like this but her character seems a bit too pathetic. Maybe Mackinnon will be funny, im sure McCarthy will just rely on fat jokes, and Jones just looks like a negative stereotype...ill wait for a new trailer to change my mind, but i doubt ill see it cuz i lack a vagina"
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"Girl-Winston even starts off as not one of the team too. They seemed to mess up Girl-Ray though, Egon was more talky about smart stuff, here Girl-Egon is only referenced as the smartest one. Like Ray was a doctor too, and funny, but Girl-Ray is too talky for the smart things.
They nailed Girl-Peter though with the humor and you can tell she's been new-age-ified for her social outgoing-ness.

(Incase anyone missed my point, this is literally just a cash grab trying to aim at women with a gender swap, and likely will hide behind claims of sexism for pointing out any flaws with the characters)"
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,The trailer looked very cheesy. I dont know what else to say....
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,sorry...but.......noooooope
mDS-kzbCO08,Ghostbusters (2016) Trailer Reaction &amp; Breakdown!,"It looks like they are doing a impression of the old cast instead of being real people.

9VvCdAopEy8,Suicide Squad Extended Cut: Worth It?,"if you're going to say that a movie needs to show you a feeling not tell you about it then you shouldn't go on your video and say you're a DC fan, or whatever, you should just show it"
9VvCdAopEy8,Suicide Squad Extended Cut: Worth It?,I guess I don't hate Jai Courtney because the only thing other than Suicide squad I've seen him in is Spartacus & he was fantastic as Varro in that!
9VvCdAopEy8,Suicide Squad Extended Cut: Worth It?,I wasn't worried about the DC films until I saw Suicide Squad. Somebody messed with that film and cut it up into pieces.
9VvCdAopEy8,Suicide Squad Extended Cut: Worth It?,"I agree this movie wasn't what it could've been. I thought it was ok but I was so disappointed, it becomes even more frustrating when you hear about some of the scenes and original ideas that ended up on the cutting room floor. I think they could've made so much more of this movie but Warner Bro's went and reduced it to the mediocre movie that we got."

Great video!"
9VvCdAopEy8,Suicide Squad Extended Cut: Worth It?,"Wanna know why there are sooooo many flashbacks? Because there should have been a movie BEFORE Suicide Squad.

9VvCdAopEy8,Suicide Squad Extended Cut: Worth It?,"I think the extended cut is supeior to the theatrical cut how both are good. However, the theatrical cut of BvS is shit while the extended cut is soooooooooooooooooooo much better."
9VvCdAopEy8,Suicide Squad Extended Cut: Worth It?,Nope.
9VvCdAopEy8,Suicide Squad Extended Cut: Worth It?,My version of the movie would be the Suicide Squad go up against Vandal Savage...

9VvCdAopEy8,Suicide Squad Extended Cut: Worth It?,"WB gave the green light for the movie, under 1condition...David Ayer can pen the Screenplay and be ready to cast and begin shooting in 3 WEEKS?...wdf did they think would happen besides an incoherent mess."
9VvCdAopEy8,Suicide Squad Extended Cut: Worth It?,I ❤ Suicide Squad
9VvCdAopEy8,Suicide Squad Extended Cut: Worth It?,the movie was shit s why would you buy it
9VvCdAopEy8,Suicide Squad Extended Cut: Worth It?,but i love jared let's joker...
9VvCdAopEy8,Suicide Squad Extended Cut: Worth It?,"The extended scenes that were in the extended version were more about Harley and Deadshot than everyone else. It's obviously that the intention of the studio was to highlight Deadshot and Harley's scenes and downplayed all the other characters, especially the Joker since he would be an attention stealer.  The Studios wanted to invest on Harley and Deadshot because they are the ones who will continue in the future sequels."
9VvCdAopEy8,Suicide Squad Extended Cut: Worth It?,The Joker is a very well know character who had several portrayals on screen and the late one won an oscar.  Jared Leto had all the expectations on his shoulder and was the most anticipated character. What WB and Ayer did with his character? They cut his several minutes scenes into scenes with just seconds or one minute at most and spread those scenes along the movie without making a logic connections between those scenes.
9VvCdAopEy8,Suicide Squad Extended Cut: Worth It?,"Was  Will Smith performance good? Where is the stamina and coldness of Deadshot, who is a hired assassin and doesn«t care if he lives or dies? Will Smith is doing what he does in all the other movies. He is this sympathetic character that is trying to do the right thing. People liked his portrayal because Deadshot is a character little known and people don't know much about him and that is why will smith portrayal passed as good. Smith along with Robbie had the most stand out scenes and also more screen time than any other character and still Smith couldn't pass the coldness and toughness that is intrinsic to Deadshot's personality. I felt that all the characters were downplayed,  because of Will Smith lack of intensity, boldness, and toughness."
9VvCdAopEy8,Suicide Squad Extended Cut: Worth It?,"well guess who wrote the lines that leto said, that were on the nose? ayer. leto has a lot of energy and hes got some solid ideas. what he needs is better direction. he needs someone to guide him of when to tone it down and when to go all out because he seems so excited about the character, at the opportunity to explore it and try different things. he's got an intensity that i like, and he plays more and has fun. he's not so...serious. i get it, ledger is amazing bla bla bla. he's subtle. well this joker isn't. hes a madman who likes to play himself up. i enjoyed it. but what really gets me with leto is the way he moves. his gestures and hand motions. the way his eyes have this blank emotionless stare. its mesmerizing to watch. he's the joker at all times. like a switch."
9VvCdAopEy8,Suicide Squad Extended Cut: Worth It?,"I completely disagree with Dan's opinion on Leto's Joker. He just wants another Heath Ledger performance, he wants the same stuff we've already seen. I loved Ledger's Joker, it was truly an incredible piece of acting. But I feel like Dan and everyone else on here wants more and more of Ledger. I want a different Joker, not the same stuff we've already had come before. They sounded like they wanted a dark, brooding Joker, wtf?! That would be boring as hell, Ledger's Joker was brooding at times, and it worked on so many levels, but the way they were talking was as if they wanted Leto to just be a miserable emo the entire time. I've wanted a balls to the wall insane Joker for a while now, and Leto gave me that in the most perfect way. He was a showman, an entertainer. And there is a version of The Joker who incorporates those themes out there, we just hadn't seen it on the big screen yet, until Leto. I admire that he didn't try to copy Ledger, sure his voice may have sounded similar, but you could tell he wasn't trying to imitate him. I think Leto's Joker voice changed a little from time to time in his scenes in the movie anyway, which I enjoyed, just highlighted The Joker's madness and capacity for wicked and crazy humour."

9VvCdAopEy8,Suicide Squad Extended Cut: Worth It?,Lmao the Dave Chappelle meme! I was not a fan of Jared Leto's Joker... it kind of comes off like he's trying too hard. It comes off as fake and not convincing. That might be why they cut out so many of his scenes lol

9VvCdAopEy8,Suicide Squad Extended Cut: Worth It?,"the problem I have with the ultimate cut, it makes the NONSENSE of Lex even worse, the LACK of compassion between  clarke/lois and batman/superman, makes the patheticness of the congressional scene and that chase that superman WAITS until the end of the massacre to scold batman. . . and MOST damning, he KILLS the guy with that crate AND stabs and follows the guy he stabbed before in the shoulder with 2nd stab in the gut and watches him die. . . JOKER one on ALL 3 counts with the ultimate! 1 win with lex/doomsday 2nd win with batman murdering, 3rd win superman giving up, and flip flopping until the nonsensical sacrifice with WM RIGHT THERE ready to catch the spear and END it. . . that opening 17 minutes SHOULD have been the foundation for the WHOLE thing, and Lex teaming with Bruce to fix smallville and metropolis, and throughout the first/second act gives bruce subtle hints at his sinister underplot.  and Clarke doing a expose on Lex and giving a copy to bruce to have him don the cape/cowl to investigate that party and WHAM better bvs ARGH"
9VvCdAopEy8,Suicide Squad Extended Cut: Worth It?,THIS is the second cut of the film. . . as in the warner cut of the ayer film.  this and ayer's were handed to that trailer company to make a THIRD movie. . . the one WE all saw in august.  Warner is so lambasted with 2 failures in 1 year and their spiteful to us at this point.  We might NEVER get that original AYER cut of the movie.

9VvCdAopEy8,Suicide Squad Extended Cut: Worth It?,DC and Warner Bros have proved that you really can't polish a turd.
9VvCdAopEy8,Suicide Squad Extended Cut: Worth It?,"If WB and the DCEU did this to Wonder Woman and Justice League in 2017, then the DCEU will become DLCEU (Detective Loser Comics Extended Universe). That's why their LOSING to Marvel Studios because of these Ultimate or Extended Edition bullsh*t!"
9VvCdAopEy8,Suicide Squad Extended Cut: Worth It?,"Exactly why they deleted these scenes from the movie, they are just ""stuff"" and dont serve a greater purpose in the film. But ppl wanted it, and they put scenes they would have criticized back in to the  movie and its not different"
9VvCdAopEy8,Suicide Squad Extended Cut: Worth It?,"birds of prey movie is already bad n doomed Im telling you.. why? bcuz they have hired the worst writer/screen writer for the movie.. its the same writer from that recently released horror/thriller movie with naomi watts in it.... and its gotten baaaad reviews... 
why wb are signing these big multi starrer story based movie is something I dont get.. too many characters starring first time which gives them less screen time  to have character developments.. basically its a female suicide squad... just make mad love movie instead giving more look on Harleens character n meeting with joker n being manipulated by him etc show the twisted relationship b their reign in gotham.. it will act like a prequel to suicide squad"
9VvCdAopEy8,Suicide Squad Extended Cut: Worth It?,"no it didnt change the movie a bit.. only the part of harley messing w crock n katana n she showed her therapist side.. 
and now they're saying bluray will have all jokers deleted scenes n batman cameo scene.... WB are seriously big fuckers.

suicide squad shouldn't even happen now its too early. boomerang should appear first in flash to have more abt him. but since ppl are way into harley n joker stuff they should make mad love.. so it gives a better fleshed out base to harleys character n understandment of her n jokers relationship n their rule in gotham n end it with harley being caught n thrown in prison. then make suicide squad after. bcuz lets face it was more of harley n deadshot + the squad of a movie. joker was in it bcuz of harley."
9VvCdAopEy8,Suicide Squad Extended Cut: Worth It?,Thumbs up for putting Charley on. She's amazing!
9VvCdAopEy8,Suicide Squad Extended Cut: Worth It?,I want a Harley Quinn movie
9VvCdAopEy8,Suicide Squad Extended Cut: Worth It?,"This ""Extended Cut"" just goes to solidify that Leto's Joker is an absolutely hopelessly flat interpretation of the character. 

He comes across as a whiney baby with no menace who is more concerned with ""talking about being the Joker"" then actually being The Joker.

There is no scene in this entire movie where he is shown to be as extremely violent and unsympathetic as the character is supposed to be. This is meant to be a guy who has and will kill men, women and children in the blink of an eye, someone so dangerous and unhinged that even his closest henchmen live in fear of what he might do to them.

How is this Joker going to play alongside Affleck's Batman, it is going to be laughable when these characters have their first onscreen interaction. 

This Joker poses no threat to Batman and Affleck's Batman is so extremely violent that he would just kill this Joker the second he was in striking distance."
9VvCdAopEy8,Suicide Squad Extended Cut: Worth It?,Absolutely not! We were robbed. I fucking hate WB! Also in the extended cuts we didn't get all the scenes! I still so bitter and pissed off!
9VvCdAopEy8,Suicide Squad Extended Cut: Worth It?,Don't waste your time on this.
9VvCdAopEy8,Suicide Squad Extended Cut: Worth It?,The Harley Flashbacks tells you what it took for Joker to accept Harley loved him. Call yourself critics
9VvCdAopEy8,Suicide Squad Extended Cut: Worth It?,THIS. Come on WB treat the DCEU with respect not as a money grabber. Matthew Vaughn probably should direct a Suicide Squad sequel.
9VvCdAopEy8,Suicide Squad Extended Cut: Worth It?,"I read comics, and I loved the life out of this movie. I can't wait for more. Harley is the best!"
9VvCdAopEy8,Suicide Squad Extended Cut: Worth It?,"Movies like BvS and Suicide Squad doesn't deserve that much attention...If you were to talk about some films that deserves attention and that are actually GOOD from this year, Hell or High water would be one, The nice guys, Arrival and even Jason Bourne even though it was disappointing, it was still MUCH better than garbage films like BvS and SS.."

9VvCdAopEy8,Suicide Squad Extended Cut: Worth It?,I enjoyed Suicide Squad but admit that it was deeply flawed. These new scenes are unlikely to change that so I wont be giving WB more money. If they release an R-RATED extended addition DIRECTOR'S cut on the other hand... but they wont

9VvCdAopEy8,Suicide Squad Extended Cut: Worth It?,"Shame, I enjoyed the movie enough to see it twice, but something really felt off with it, like something was missing. I was hoping the Extended Cut would add the missing pieces. Maybe worth picking up in a sale one day."
9VvCdAopEy8,Suicide Squad Extended Cut: Worth It?,"The extended version was originally produced by Peter Jackson with the release of the Lord of the Rings franchise over ten years ago. At the time it was necessary, seeing as how people were not accustomed to sitting in a theater for such a long period of time at that time. Peter Jackson's continuation with the extended version makes sense (and somewhat poetic in said continuity) seeing as how he started it with the Lord of the Rings pictures and moved on with the Hobbit pictures (no comment on the King Kong extended, though). Since then, however, producers have recognized the significant cash flow of the extended edition despite the fact that TODAY it's unnecessary. People are not afraid to sit three to four hours in a movie theater to watch a movie, and to release the same movie TWICE is just a means to grab more money. Simply release the whole movie in one shot. For this reason, I would say to boycott the whole extended version theme UNLESS it is the Lord of the Rings or the Hobbit. That's just me, though."

9VvCdAopEy8,Suicide Squad Extended Cut: Worth It?,One thing that we must always remember.Leto joker was not his fault.That was the way that the director wanted him to be.Plus he wrote the movie himself. The biggest problem fans have here that no one is talking about is.Why is this joker is still alive. Also the word damage on his forehead.Wb have great actors.But for some reason .They gave two directors .Who's strings of films.That are somewhat successful. Play with a group of colorful Hero's.

9VvCdAopEy8,Suicide Squad Extended Cut: Worth It?,"I think Ayer getting a whole six weeks to write the thing shows. It's not horrible, but he could've used more time to look it over and make some changes. 

I wouldn't say the extended cut made this any more worth buying. It's definitely not like the BvS UE. 

If WB wants to make money, put out that alternate cut. It sounds like this cut was polished enough to be not far from being sellable at least on iTunes, Amazon, etc."
9VvCdAopEy8,Suicide Squad Extended Cut: Worth It?,...no
9VvCdAopEy8,Suicide Squad Extended Cut: Worth It?,is the suicide squad movie worth to buy
9VvCdAopEy8,Suicide Squad Extended Cut: Worth It?,"Pretty much nailed it on the standards bit. I'm that seemingly rare person that likes both. But I like DC more. I grew up on reruns of 60's Batman, Batman the animated series and the rest of the old DCAU, the 70's Superman, the Burton and Schumacher Batman's (which aren't nearly as bad when you realize it's meant to be like the 60's series), even the Green Hornet - I want the DCEU to succeed as well as their CW shows mostly have (as much potential as Gotham has in it's cast I still find that show an abomination). But they do need to get their act together. The thing with Squad is that while it is, dare I say lighter, than BvS, it has the same writing and editing issues and it's  pretty short film by comparison. DC needs to make movies long as they need to be within reason. They need 3 hours to tell the story? Use 3 hours long as it's good because all those LotR movies are in their base form, 4+ hours extended. And the thing is, DC is casting well. Yes, Eisenberg was a massive misstep, that they could potentially write out for the real Lex, little as we get I liked all the characters. And there is a ton of potential but they wasted it on rushed/bad writing. At least unlike BvS, which you guys point out in the Honest Trailer of it, they didn't blow about 5 awesome storylines for movies on one mess of a film. 

That said, it more than deserves a better written sequel. And actually, I think they can handle multiple characters just fine. It's literally just the story and editing... except for the terrible writing for Superman (Seriously, were at a point he's killed a Robin and possibly had a ""killing Joke"" style event and the Bat hasn't killed Joker, Supes with probably half a dozen non lethal ways to disarm a human with a gun should not go straight to death by high speed impact and blunt force trauma, and the wording and all at the hearing and stuff rings to question has he done this other times besides that and Zod) and Snyder seemingly killing characters off to spite the Fan Base for not taking MoS as well as he wanted. I'm thinking with the Harley movie they just need 5 characters, Harley and Ivy, Katana (you introduced her, use her some more, especially since she may have been sent to track Harley down),  Black Canary, and Barbra Gordon (as Oracle). I don't list Joker cause it's a Harley movie, he's going to have some kind of roll chasing her to get her back or maybe shes out for payback cause he's wronged her again. 

As far as Ayer goes, I'm willing to give him another shot. Keep Goyer away from the movies. Sure, he has names like Blade and work on the Nolan Batman's to his credit. He also has the Not as well received Blade stuff, both Ghost Rider movies, Mos, BvS, and that Nick Fury movie Marvel would like everyone to forget about with the Hoff. That last one in particular I think should send up some red flags. And I'm sorry, but anything beyond visuals because I can't deny he does that right, keep Snyder away from things. Only reason I'm not dreading Wonder Woman since he's listed as a writer is that two other people are working the screen play and one of those two is Geoff Johns. It's really do or die for DCEU right now. If Wonder Woman and Justice League don't meet fan expectations, theres a good chance no one shows up to Flash and Aquaman the next year."

9VvCdAopEy8,Suicide Squad Extended Cut: Worth It?,Why is Steven Seagal in the lineup at timestamp 7:58. Before someone comments that it's not and I'm stupid...it' a visual joke.
9VvCdAopEy8,Suicide Squad Extended Cut: Worth It?,Thank you Screen Junkies for taking over Clevver Movies. I enjoy this channel ALOT more now lol
9VvCdAopEy8,Suicide Squad Extended Cut: Worth It?,"I love it that seconds after denying that they are Marvel shills the host says ""I prefer Marvel Comics!"""
9VvCdAopEy8,Suicide Squad Extended Cut: Worth It?,:'( what happened to Suicide Squad? There is some stuff in the movie I loved but the story was sooooo... meh.
9VvCdAopEy8,Suicide Squad Extended Cut: Worth It?,"The joker is Robin, he has memory loss in extended cut, maybe that would be a cool thing that Harley Quinn discovered that fact and tried to cover up that fct by erasing his memories."
9VvCdAopEy8,Suicide Squad Extended Cut: Worth It?,"Not worth it. DC movies are meh, Batman is all they've really got to stay in the race with Marvel. I will say this, though: I will watch a Deadshot any day so make this happen"
9VvCdAopEy8,Suicide Squad Extended Cut: Worth It?,"I had fun with the theatrical cut of Suicide Squad and that is the first movie in the DCEU I felt that way about.  I'm skipping this Extended Cut because A) I'm tired of not getting the full movie from the get-go (nothing new, I know but still) and B) I'm willing to say I saw SS once, had fun with it and am leaving well enough alone."
9VvCdAopEy8,Suicide Squad Extended Cut: Worth It?,"It does worry me that just over the summer they showed us their (DC) movie timeline and they're throwing in random movies before others come like Man of Steel 2 and the Harley movie. I think Wonder Woman will be good, prayers to Justice League and The Flash"
9VvCdAopEy8,Suicide Squad Extended Cut: Worth It?,"Man, they are really taking this Extended Universe in DCEU literally."
9VvCdAopEy8,Suicide Squad Extended Cut: Worth It?,The DCEU has DLC's now
9VvCdAopEy8,Suicide Squad Extended Cut: Worth It?,"Not really worth it. Some character interactions were added, but with not much more context , it's a plus but not enough for me."
9VvCdAopEy8,Suicide Squad Extended Cut: Worth It?,"It's a rental at best. Don't spend full price for this, plus most of the clips are already on YouTube."
9VvCdAopEy8,Suicide Squad Extended Cut: Worth It?,it's just cash grab
9VvCdAopEy8,Suicide Squad Extended Cut: Worth It?,"My problem with all these Leto's Joker critic is that there are so many types of insanity and the way it can be portrayed! There are quite psychopaths, there are loud and 'in your face' psychopaths! Moreover, there are THREE types of Joker in the comics - a criminal, an anarchist and a fucking crazy and violent one. Jared Leto is playing a crazy person who cannot control their face, emotions, mood swings - anything! 

P.S. Oh, you don't see a bike and randomly have weird thoughts? Maybe you are not crazy like Harley? Don't forget - she is as insane as the Joker. It means her mind works in a different way."
9VvCdAopEy8,Suicide Squad Extended Cut: Worth It?,"The iTunes version isn't the extended cut, just the VUDU one is."
9VvCdAopEy8,Suicide Squad Extended Cut: Worth It?,~_~ I'm so tired of the comparisons.. tbh I liked the Jack Nicholson Joker more than the Heath Ledger Joker. And I did enjoy Jared Leto so much. All in all I enjoyed all 3 Jokers in their own ways. =_= All good job.
9VvCdAopEy8,Suicide Squad Extended Cut: Worth It?,I actually thought the extended cut was worse than the theatrical cut because in my opinion all they did was add a bunch of bad and pointless scenes to an already bad movie.
9VvCdAopEy8,Suicide Squad Extended Cut: Worth It?,"I really enjoyed the theatrical version. Somethings could been better but, i can't wait to see the extra 11 minutes"
9VvCdAopEy8,Suicide Squad Extended Cut: Worth It?,"I didn't really like the film but I liked a fair few of the extra bits, the rest of the squad getting a few more lines was a nice bonus for me, hope to see a suicide squad sequel just because the premise is too good not to explore more"
9VvCdAopEy8,Suicide Squad Extended Cut: Worth It?,"I liked Suicide Squad but hated Jared Leto's Joker and he didn't have as little screen time as people made it sound. Maybe I feel like this because I didn't like his Joker or maybe everyone else wanted more screen time from the most iconic character in the movie. I don't know but I liked the movie and understand why people didn't, I'm easily entertained by an action movie so I'm not bothered."
9VvCdAopEy8,Suicide Squad Extended Cut: Worth It?,'member when David Ayer said there would be no Ultimate or Extended Cut of this film?
9VvCdAopEy8,Suicide Squad Extended Cut: Worth It?,"Fuck Extended Cut, we need a Director's Cut, it's not enough to add scenes, they need to remove some too."
9VvCdAopEy8,Suicide Squad Extended Cut: Worth It?,"Not even a 4 hour cut could save this movie, I wanted to like it because I think BvS extended cut it's a great movie, I had faith, and I saw my expectations get shattered on screen, the film for me doesn't have even one rediming quality, and the worst of all? 

The fact that the studio let the fucking marketing team make a cut of the movie because people seemed to like the second trailer the most, Suicide Squad it's the definition of what's wrong with hollywood big movies and super hero films."
9VvCdAopEy8,Suicide Squad Extended Cut: Worth It?,i was subbed to clever news and now this popped up in my feed
9VvCdAopEy8,Suicide Squad Extended Cut: Worth It?,"yeah, fuck this movie. Such a great opportunity for DC to make something special, completely squandered and ruined by people who just dont care about any of these characters.. DC/WB only care about money and the sad thing is, they could of made 5x as much with an actual great movie."
9VvCdAopEy8,Suicide Squad Extended Cut: Worth It?,"Joe, can you please name your kid Patrick?"
9VvCdAopEy8,Suicide Squad Extended Cut: Worth It?,this video makes me wanna go watch the dark knight again
9VvCdAopEy8,Suicide Squad Extended Cut: Worth It?,I know this ain't the popular choice I want a little bit more Slipknot
9VvCdAopEy8,Suicide Squad Extended Cut: Worth It?,Charley nails it. I am a huge DC fan and I don't like the movies because they keep squandering everything! DC/Warner Bros needs to get their shit together.
9VvCdAopEy8,Suicide Squad Extended Cut: Worth It?,This movie was so disappointing
9VvCdAopEy8,Suicide Squad Extended Cut: Worth It?,Yes! Dan has just explained how I feel about Jared Leto's joker. I hated it so much!
9VvCdAopEy8,Suicide Squad Extended Cut: Worth It?,Okay this an exteneded version if you buy DVDS they have deleted scenes someone buy the freaking DVD and tell me if Joker scenes are there I feel like they're actual deleted scenes that aren't inculded as an extended version please someone buy the DVD and tell me if it's there UNLESS here's a theory they're using the scenes that aren't there for Margot's Harley movie??? What if she is O_O
9VvCdAopEy8,Suicide Squad Extended Cut: Worth It?,"I haven't seen the extended cut yet but I plan on getting it because I'm into that kind of stuff. Personally, I think that Leto's Joker is a really good interpretation of the character and is a faithful portrayal because the Joker, to me, is a theatrical psycho. He has his own brand of murder, with his infamous laughing gas, for example. Leto's Joker may not be as developed as Ledger's Joker and is way more in-your-face but it is still a very interesting take. The Joker in Suicide Squad fit well with his environment, just like every other interpretation that has been before, and I think that if you changed him then it would ruin the movie and mess up the approach."
9VvCdAopEy8,Suicide Squad Extended Cut: Worth It?,No the film sucks buffalo dick
9VvCdAopEy8,Suicide Squad Extended Cut: Worth It?,"nice, some optimistic, not like winny ass bitches cinefix"
9VvCdAopEy8,Suicide Squad Extended Cut: Worth It?,"Saw suicide squad for the first time today, wow its way worse than what people made it out to be. And what the fucking fuck was jared leto doing with the joker!!! Every scene with the joker was so cringey I felt as if my ball sack was going to shrink into my pelvis."
9VvCdAopEy8,Suicide Squad Extended Cut: Worth It?,am i the only one whos video is out of sync
9VvCdAopEy8,Suicide Squad Extended Cut: Worth It?,don't worry for the jared leto's joker ben affleck will fix all the problems with this version of the joker
9VvCdAopEy8,Suicide Squad Extended Cut: Worth It?,hey this guy is on the nick animation podcast
9VvCdAopEy8,Suicide Squad Extended Cut: Worth It?,"I'm done with DC movies, but I still have some hope for Ben Affleck's ""The Batman""."
9VvCdAopEy8,Suicide Squad Extended Cut: Worth It?,You got anymore Joker scenes lmao
9VvCdAopEy8,Suicide Squad Extended Cut: Worth It?,I needed a drink after the theatrical release only because I was soooooo freakin' excited due to the trailers.... only to be let down. This is worse than bad sex.
9VvCdAopEy8,Suicide Squad Extended Cut: Worth It?,I enjoyed the theatrical version of suicide squad so I'm sure I'll like the extended cut even more.
9VvCdAopEy8,Suicide Squad Extended Cut: Worth It?,"my biggest disappointment with the suicide squad movie was how nice the ""villains"" are. I wanted them to be out for themselves, because that's what made them so different and interesting to me, because they weren't the avengers. a good example is how Deadshot is told he can be with his daughter if he shoots Harley before she gets away, so he misses on purpose, and the other ""villains"" are like ""nice one mate"". really corny and kinda out of character. I think it would have been more interesting and surprising if they committed to him being a bad guy and he tried to actually kill her, so that he could see his daughter. they were just too nice, and corny sometimes."
9VvCdAopEy8,Suicide Squad Extended Cut: Worth It?,"A lot of the Joker lines were improvised by Jared Leto and it showed... it just came off kinda try hard. 
I think a better director could have controlled his performance, and giving us only the good stuff he tried putting out there."
9VvCdAopEy8,Suicide Squad Extended Cut: Worth It?,"I liked Suicide Squad. It's not perfect but imo pretty good. I haven't seen extendet cut yet but I'm kinda looking forward to it. Even tho I expected more than that 11 mins.
And wtf?? You're saying that Jared Leto's Joker is bad because he's all out with the crazy? Have you ever heard Hamill's Joker? He's all out crazy too and he is the best Joker ever. So Leto have a good potentional and is really good playing Joker. Of course the way how he looks is something different. That's not Leto's fault but the creators fault I guess."
9VvCdAopEy8,Suicide Squad Extended Cut: Worth It?,its still a piece of shit just watch that one joker scene they added on youtube don't give money to this piece of shit marketing gimmick
9VvCdAopEy8,Suicide Squad Extended Cut: Worth It?,Imagine if they made another extended cut with all of the joker scenes in. I think that would make people mad because they could have already bought it on iTunes.
9VvCdAopEy8,Suicide Squad Extended Cut: Worth It?,I just wanted to see joker with the grenade and katana using her soulblade ffs.
9VvCdAopEy8,Suicide Squad Extended Cut: Worth It?,"The fact that this video is 15 min long and the extended cut is *extended* by 13 minutes, you could have just easily put all the new clips into this video and add 2 min commentary."
9VvCdAopEy8,Suicide Squad Extended Cut: Worth It?,Dafuq you saying? Jared Leto is nothing like the Heath ledger joker
9VvCdAopEy8,Suicide Squad Extended Cut: Worth It?,This movie was awful please let it die
9VvCdAopEy8,Suicide Squad Extended Cut: Worth It?,"Suicide Squad was pretty garbage. I'm a Marvel and DC fanboy. Loving both is allowed. But seriously, Suicide Squad sucked."
9VvCdAopEy8,Suicide Squad Extended Cut: Worth It?,Ledger wasn't funny. That doesn't mean anything Hector.
9VvCdAopEy8,Suicide Squad Extended Cut: Worth It?,"I really enjoy this news channel guys, its like a small movie fight everyday, i love it!! keep it up!!!"
9VvCdAopEy8,Suicide Squad Extended Cut: Worth It?,"NO. This DLCEU is annoying... ""Let's cut some scenes just to sell the movie twice!"""

prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Danielle's only point about her love pick was she could leave him in a tube. She then spent the rest talking about Beast. I think Joe should have won hands down for actually talking about his pick.

prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),That beauty and the beast argument was some Stockholm syndrome sh*t.
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Joe sold me on Bright needing at least 3 prequels to fully flush out the universe

prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"Terrible sound and having only 2 contestants is an awful idea.

prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Really disappointed in this fight I was bored. The 1v1 don't like. Or maybe it was the fighters that weren't that good. Gonna watch 1 more fight then rejudge

prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),is this shot with a different camera than everything else on SJ? The video quality seems off from everything else on the channel.
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"What is up with this video, the quality is really bad even at 720p."
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Please go back to the old days
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"Movie Fights 🤔 more like Movie Fail. 

I tried..."
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),The best movie was unquestionably Blade Runner 2049
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"I am a huge supporter of what you guys do. I am a lover of movies, pop culture and all things cinema so I will continue to stand by you (Screen Junkies) and support as always... i would like to say that there are both, things i like about the new Movie Fights format and things I don't necessarily care for. I will agree with the rest of the comments and say that id like the combatants to be able to sit.it feels more intimate that way and there is a bit more energy. Hal is great... sometimes in doses lol and the vote feature is great. id love to talk about moves with you guys but in the meantime, i will enjoy the materials you release. Keep it up"
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"Time stamp links to each fight. This is amateur stuff, Screenjunkies...."
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Bright is dope af ! To each their own I guess lol
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"1. mother!
2.Lycan
3. Lindsay Duncan (Gifted)"
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Great job Danielle!!!
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"Oh my gosh, it's so good to have ya'll back! I love Hal as host."
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),I liked Bright. Sorry
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Joe star likes emoji movie over bright. Waaaaat
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Kumail nanjiani is a good comedian but a bad actor. He can only do the stereotype awkward guy role. The movie was nice but not the best.
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"I actually only just caught up on why changes happened. Sorry to hear and I'm glad it was taken so seriously and things have resumed. But it's quite obvious from the comments that the previous format worked better. Multiple judges could be a great thing, but the three fighters definitely seems to be the go. I also prefer mulitple quicker fights rather than 3 longer ones. I see arguments that people can go deeper, but when there's one fight I don't connect with (sometimes I just don't want to hear anything about a movie before I've seen it, and we outside the US often get films later) I'll often skip through it, but with the new format you lose a huge chunk of the show.

Thanks for keeping it going though! :-)"
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"Get Out was a great little thriller.  However, the praise it is getting is massively disproportionate"
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),I'm so glad movie fights is back but please get rid of this new set. The debate/game show style feels way too formal; I miss the more laid back and relatable vibe of people sitting around a table talking face to face about movies
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),2 fighters is boring lol bring back 3
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"More judges than fighters?! Crazy lol. Great fight but like EVERYONE else said already, I missed the show but I also miss the three fighter setup. Also #bringbackthechairs"
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"I generally agree with the comments to bring back the third fighter, but hey folks! Stick it out for the new format. With all that SJ has been through, maybe this makes the most sense to them. Let them catch their stride again."
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"im sorry but what is going on with this set. the carpet, the tiles"
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),AM I the only one missing the old format? this is horrible.
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),sorry the old fight set up was way better
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Them standing is stressing me out.
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),I appreciate the effort but the old Movie fights format was wayyy more enjoyable
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),I would love to see an all animated Disney movie fight with Brian Hull
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"I really wanted to like the new format. But I don't. I would prefer to see 3 fighters in a more relaxed setting. This seems to have the fun sucked out of it. Each fight is way too drawn out. I like Hal as the host but would like him to lead the fighters less. Having 3 judges is good though. 

In fact it is less of a fight and more of a discussion.

The audio it a bit weird. Also instead of the polls I would rather see the reintroduction of the 'fans on the couch' as your popular vote.

I will probably keep checking in to see if the format is changed and the fun is brought back, otherwise the show the way it is now is not for me. Which is cool, especially if lots of people are enjoying the new look and format.
Good luck!"
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"Yikes. Because it's so back and forth, polite, and moderated so heavily - Hal had to manufacture a ""passionate"" moment between the fighters (min 35)."
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Hal is a good host! Im glad Dan is more involved. Love the new set! These 2 fighters are 👌 but something is off. Finding it hard to keep watching tho
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"Yeah, I gotta agree that the new formula feels a little stiff so far :x"
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Couldn't agree more on The Big Sick. It's incredibly rewatchable as well.
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"bring back the old format, please."
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Def need a third fighter. made the show a lil funner.
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"Good idea to keep hosts and contestants standing apart, to avoid unwanted touching."
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"1) Three judges: Yes
2) Sound: very echoish
3) Two contestants: needs 3 or maybe 4, but less fights?
4) All lists need at least 4... Digging the changes, I hope you keep an eye on the fan crits and adjust to make best best of Movie Fights 2.0"
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"I really prefer when the guys sit down, it makes me feel so uptight not as chilled"
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),I thought the absence of movie fights meant that they were reworking this new version. I'm a bit disappointed :(
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"Why does everyone care so much whether they’re sitting or standing? They’ve said they prefer to stand, I don’t see why anything else should matter"
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"2 things. 

1- Bright was an awesome movie
2- Bring back 3 fighters"
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"It needs a 3rd fighter and this is ""Movie Fights"" Not ""Movie Respectable Debates"", right? lol."
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Oh hi Rogue
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),wait if we talking about the worst movie of 2017 why dont we talk about Wonder Wheel ?
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"Dunkirk was the best movie, Joe."
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Hope you didn't spend much on that set...
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"When Worst Movie come up and neither answer is Emoji Movie, I'm gone. Byyyyyyeeeeee."
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"Love Hal, Love Movie fights but I unfortunately must echo the comments of others. Please go back to three fighters.  I really loved to watch movie fights because I felt it was like friends sitting around arguing about movies.  I like the judges and I like that you guys are trying new things, but this two fighters standing makes it feel like a low budget game show rather than friends having a fun fight.  It also pretty much eliminates the ability to bring in fun guest stars.  Or at least makes that much less fun."
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),I would prefer to see everyone standing on their heads while fighting.
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),3 fighters please
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Bright was good...
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"""At best it was shitty Valerian"" LOL damn..."
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"Going off Joe's own definition of a good villain the answer has got to be Kevin Wendell Crumb (James McAvoy) in Split. Fantastic acting and premise , and a total surprise movie. I'm astonished at the lack of love for it here.

Also, Get Out is grossly overrated. How was that movie scary?"
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),This for real is an hour
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),LOVE THE NEW MONTAGE.
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"Why are all the complaints about the fighters standing? Are you trying to project your own laziness onto others? Did none of you take debate in high school? Standing is part of the culture, helps you project your arguments and exude confidence."
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Can Roth or Roxy host please?
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),It's so great to have movie fights back! My only thing I would change would be having three Fighters instead of two
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Hal as host is amazing and super funny but 3 fighterz please
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),It is 13 minutes in and I just realized that I zoned off almost immediately. This format makes it so much more boring. Please make it less formal!
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"I like the three judges. I also thought I’d like only two fighters. While it helps the episodes stay on time, I felt the arguments were a little flat without an extra person to help unbalance things a little. At the end of the day, MF should be entertaining and three fighters resulted in more laugh out loud moments than only two. I don’t mind fewer main arguments, though."
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"I liked Dan with headphones, made him seem like the ""eye in the sky"""
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),You guys could have maintained the older format. I feel like this is too formal.
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"I was skeptical of the new format when you guys did the test run in December, but this episode was full of a lot of fun and happy energy. Definitely needed, new movie fights is growing on me fast."
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"So glad to see that you guys are getting your groove back, creep-free. Clearly still some kinks to work out (3 fighters pls) but I'm so happy that the channel lives on and is working really hard to overcome past issues, awesome job guys!"
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),I enjoyed it  but bright was shot way too dark
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"The new set, three judges, and new graphics are good but bring back the third guy and let them sit down."
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"Hal is a great host, but PLEASE BRING BACK THREE FIGHTERS"
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"I suspect even if they go back to something akin to the old format, Drunk Movie Fights won't return.  In light of what happened, it's probable that management wants a more professional environment.  A lot of companies have eliminated all alcohol consumption, including at company picnics and holiday parties due to liability and insurance."
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),I would say that the Vulture in Spider Man: Homecoming was one of the strongest villains of 2017. The character actually had a point and he was played superbly by Michael Keaton. Great video!
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"I appreciate the changes (definitely feels like there's less chance of bias with three judges). Still, it feels like some of the fun was lost. The standing and the podiums feel more formal, as others pointed out. Also, there was something more dynamic about having three fighters. Great job moving forward overall!"
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),I loved Bright even with it's mistakes
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"I, Tonya. was the best film of the year please go watch it."
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"When he said Dunkirk, I flipped a table."
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),How did emoji movie not get called out for worst of the year?
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"Not compelling at all. Movie Fights wasn't broken, the host was. No one fights like Dan and since he got cheated (lol) out of his belt I've been waiting for him to battle for it back. In this format I wouldn't even watch, though."
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"I had no idea people would care this much about standing combattants. Sorry, I don't get it."
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Get Out was meh.
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"for the umpteenth comment:

3 fighters, sit em down, otherwise logos and formatting can stay"
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"I understand why you guys felt you needed to change it up, but please go back to 3 fighters and sitting down."
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Are you going to do a best series of 2017 video?
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),24:41 BULLS**T !!!!!
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Bright was a good movie Don't be a hater.

prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),The video quality/focus is hazy for some reason?
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),This new format is boring.
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),This is tough...
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"I missed movie fights, thanks for bringing it back."
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Old format worked. Bring it back.
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),3 Fighters PLZ it was better. And take a seat for god sakes.
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"Another good episode! :) Did Max Landis do something to hurt ScreenJunkies? Just curious because he got shat on pretty hard during the whole Bright discussion (not that I'm saying it was a good movie...I just thought it was a cool concept...but it was scattered and several things didn't make a lot of sense). Anyway, still enjoying Movie Fights! Good questions this episode :)"
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"I´ma put my brain in yo body! Love the format, especially the judging system. Bring back the third fighter, please."
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"Better in every way, except only having two fighters still makes it inferior to the old format."
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"First the critics hated Bright then the audience said that they really liked it so now the critics are telling themselves an audience of millions simply hatewatched the movie? Why can't people just accept that other people might like something that they don't? I thought Bright was fun and entertaining. No hatewatching of it in my household.

Also, did none of these people see Chips or did they forget that that came out in 2017?"
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),This Is Garbage 🤦🏽‍♂️
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"Love the new duel-camera work and the on-screen point counter. Love the fact that there are 3 judges.
Hal makes a great host, but I hope they still have guest judges at times ... cough ... Alicia Malone ... cough ...
Not a huge fan of there only being 2 fighters."
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Just do it like it was before. This looks like political debate. Really bad.
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Three fighters please. This is too... boring. I like how chaotic it would get at times. Felt like a bunch of my friends an I when we are discussing something. This feels like I am at school or some work event to measured and tempered.
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),please do the greatest showman
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Competitors sitting down makes everything way more relaxed
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Do blue Mountain state please
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),I don’t know anyone outside of reviewers and wannabe reviewers who hate watched Bright. Most of the people I spoke to who saw really liked it.
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"The nice thing about the old format -- with a group of people sitting at a table -- was that it felt more relaxed and easygoing, as if the fighters were really just a bunch of people hanging out at a bar and having nerdy arguments like any gang of movie-obsessed friends would. It was instantly relatable. You guys should reconsider letting go of the old sit-down format. There was something really warm and inviting about that vibe.

Having said all that, though: it's good to see you back and fighting again! :)"
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"How to appeal to the commenters while also keeping this totally okay format. Get high stools for them to sit on, move a table in to be the third fighter  or even bring it up to four. Keep 3 judges, keep Hal standing (Suffer Hal) and keep everything else. Increase the public vote to 2 if needed to break ties"
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Great to have MF back looks good. Just needs 3 fighters.
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"Save Joe Starr's quadriceps, let them sit! Also bring back the third fighter, we'll love you forever."
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),please stop with this format):
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"Movie fights works best when there's equal parts comedy and insightful commentary but this one was neither of those things.  Sorry but this one was cringeworthy to watch.  The Dan and Spencer one worked better because you had the serious fighter vs the comedy fighter.  If you're going to have 2 fighters then stick to Buddy Film conventions, pit a comedian against a ""straight man"" (serious person)."
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Time codes for fights please ? I think once I get used to the new format I will be ok with it. I think you picked two boring fighters to launch the new format with.
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),I like the new studio. But three fighters are definitely needed. And seats for the fighters. It looks like an awkward game of Jeopardy. I liked the more dynamic arguing with three fighters.
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Bright weren’t that bad
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),How can no one say Logan?
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Do honest trailer of thor ragnarok
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"I can't do it...  It's not nearly as energetic or fun.  I toughed it out through the first episode, but I'm bagging it before the voting of round one.  If you can't fix the format, just kill the show and do something else."
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"Also, how dare you. Bright was a great movie! I can't wait to see the sequel"
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"This is the worst movie fight I have watched, how can you call this a fight when all they said was, yeah that movie is better cause of this. Oh but that movie is great. Love sucks but it is a great movie."
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"I loved this. Hal is great as judge and then I love Joe and Danielle. I will agree that I liked 3 fighters more, but this was still really fun. Hopefully you guys don't get down from any mean comments because you guys clearly put a lot of thought into the new format."
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"3 fighters please!... Only 11 minutes and I'm bored....... Sorry, I know you're trying :("
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"The new format makes sense, I can see that if people ask for chairs though in the next iteration, the 'fighters' will be sat in leather swivel chairs, the presenter wearing a tie and the title will be written in a cursive font: 'Screen Addicts: Film Debates' which I would be all for if they could drink through out and slowly descend into a drunken argument where they scream the other is a hack. I haven't got to the cinema much at all this year but my best movie was 'Silence' ( I live in Japan and it struck a chord ) and the worst ( I saw in the cinema) is a difficult choice as I didn't see anything really terrible but I have to say TLJ was very disappointing."
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Danielle and Joe are delightful
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"They don’t feel comfortable going back to the old format after what happened, and you can’t really blame for that. Plus the old format was not as good as everyone seems to be making out. It was OTT confrontational to the point people would just yell over each other. I do prefer three people though"
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"I did not agree with a single thing Joe starr  said . bright was awesome.  use you remote and adjust the screen setting. the writers  didnt paint the orc/black people allegory, audiences did, in fact the orc gangs more like Latino gang in appearance  and stop hating on Landis,  at least he contributes to the things he likes it's just a shame that his projects are ripped from him because of petty scrutiny"
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"Didn't see a reason to change the format. Return to form, including old set. It's kind of unwatchable as is"
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"I don't see the need to completely reshape the show after the drama. Feels like Movie Fights was neutered.😔 And by the way, what a snob of Joe Starr to basically call Dunkirk a kids movie. It's an achievement in filmmaking. And The Big Sick is fantastic as well but let's be real bro."
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"I'm late to the party here, but I'm kinda glad that you guys got rid of the table and switched it up. To go on with the same format with what happened would've been kinda awkward to watch, so I'm very happy with the new format, Hal is a great host!!  Plus, I really like having 2 contestants, makes it easier to follow along, but I do think having 3 contestants would be cool for special episodes here and there. Any word on if flick-bait is coming back? I LOVED seeing all of the funny segments, and am totally having Scoops McGee withdrawals!!"

prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),I love only having 2 fighters. it makes it so much less chaotic - the 3 people shouting over each other in the old show used to kill me.
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),3 fighters and 5 questions please
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"Oh my god, what did you do to the show ? The studio SUCKS , looks like one of those TV shows from 90s (yeah not everything from 90s was great ). The audio sounds like it was recorded on the toilet while fighitng with diarrhea rather than a movie fight. The whole concept is just impersonal, feels like political debate the night before the election. I was hoping to close this with something positive, so yeah I am very positive that your lights suck too."
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Can you please do Star Wars: The Last Jedi?
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"I gotta agree with most of the other comments about the new format. The reason the old movie fights was so good is how natural it felt with a bunch of good friends sitting down to talk movies. The rules were there to keep things moving but weren't too important and everyone just felt comfortable. The new format doesn't feel comfortable for anyone and the two fighters opposite eachother is much more confrontational than the friendly banter before. Just my opinions though, I still love the show and I wish y'all luck in the future!"

prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"Would everyone please STOP asking for 3 fighters. It's clearly a copyright issue with the formerly-hired (and very loud) host. Great job creating new content, Screenjunkies"
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),I only watched The Big Sick because I really had run out of movies to watch on the plane.
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),The Big Sick was a great film. But 'Get Out' is a film for our time. It will be remembered for years to come as the best film of this year.
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"Old format please, keep the three judge thing, Hal is a perfect host!"

prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Do an honest trailer of napoleon dynamite. Please!!!!
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Get Out did get more love than The Big Sick way more attention
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"All I see is 'Bring back three fighters'. I personally disagree so think that a compromise should be made.
I think that doing a 2v2 fight would be an alright idea. Two teams of two players on each and they have a debate.
Then the winning team gets split in two and they have a quick one-on-one to be crowned the ultimate winner. 
This means that there are over 3 fighters so there is more craziness BUT there are still only two teams so there is still a focus on the arguments."
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Ok guys look I understand you have to change stuff but please listen to what the fans want the show just isn’t as good like this it’s less dynamic and boring
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),I feel like I’m watching a court case. I really liked how fun and like light it was with the 3 fighters. I feel like there isn’t a huge difference between this and all their other videos of them respectfully stating their opinions about movies in their other videos. It’s movie fights. Let them fight!
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),I request honest trailer for Balkan shadows
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Do Balkan shadows
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"Go back to 3 fighters this is kinda boring with only 2, and it makes me mildly uncomfortable watching them stand for an hour"
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"Going to pile on here. There should be three fighters. Yes, with two, you can go ""deeper"" into the topics, but it's less dynamic. I think that's also because fighters are standing. Sitting around a desk makes the participants more relaxed, therefore my lively. Standing behind a podium feels staid and formal, like a political debate. This new format feels less like movie ""fights"" and more like ""longer and more structured conversations normally had on SJU.""

Huge fan of the channel, and Movie Fights WAS my favorite thing on Youtube, period. Still waiting on the ""heat"" to come back."
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),plz take the people vote out. its just favorite person fighting and just favorite answer without taking the arguments into their decision making.
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),i dig a lot of the new format but the dynamic is much better with three fighters and you should really let them sit. standing for an hour is uncomfortable for me to watch them do let alone them actually doing it.
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"@SkinnyEMedia. 

BABY DRIVER, T2: TRAINSPOTTING, BELKO EXPERIMENT, GOING IN STYLE, GET OUT, PADDINGTON 2, SHAPE OF WATER, THE FOUNDER, and ROMAN J. ISRAEL, ESQ. are some of the best films of 2017.

As far as worse films are concerned, I found CULT OF CHUCKY, SUBURBICON, mother!, and A MONSTER CALLS as disappointing-than-usual. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEJNVBmpniw"

prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"whatever the changes are or arent made on movie fights, id argue the main screen junkies channel simply needs more programming than just honest trailers and movie fights (and the semi-occasional hal show).  from a quality standpoint, the channel has slipped behind SJ news IMO"

prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Can we just stop and appreciate the Breezango shirt Joe starr is wearing.
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"Great to see Movie Fights back!  I'm sure after an adjustment period we'll all get used to the changes but it does feel a little sparse without a third fighter.  The old set up felt more intimate with at least two people on camera most, if not all the time.  Plus, you got to see the other fights silent reactions which are missing here somewhat.  It's still a great show and Hal's a wonderful host as always.  Onward and upward in 2018, guys!"

-please be seated
-I consider a 3 judge panel a good idea but do not count the poles as a vote ( we have seen over the years how they usually turn towards popular movies instead of facts and this will ultimately make it so contestants do not have the incentive to argue indie or less known movies ).
Happy you guys are back. Thanks :D"

prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Please listen to the fans
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"Just throwing in my comment in support for a third fighter. Also, no ill will towards these two, but man... Two of your most awkward personalities for these topics? Lol Not a biggie. Loved it y’all"
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Who the hell wanted an update of movie fights. I don't want to see 2 fighters and a new set etc...
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"2 fighters doesnt work, its to slow, its more like a conversation than a debate/fight. Hal is fine as a host but he talks to much about nothing rather than asking more questions, and i dont think  this show need that kind of a host but more like a judge to control the fight and so the fighters have 1 to talk to, they seem confused of who to talk to with this 3 judges. What i really like is the split screen so we see both of them and that the background music for speedround is gone."
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Honest trailer of an Honest trailer
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),they should have the option to sit down at the very least
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),This is the first time I’ve ever even heard of The Big Sick. I don’t remember it even being advertised at my cinema. Dunno how I managed to miss something apparently so massive for the entire year lol
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"I miss the old format, not because I'm opposed to change but it just felt more fun and involving to watch. And please pleeease do more Drunk Fights and Harry Potter fights!"
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"I tried to resist but have to ask here....If its only me or the host is really sounding like ""Janice"" of Friends??"
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),danielle is so damn cute
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"This isn't working, listen to yours subscribers, 3 fighters please! And I don't care if the fighters are upside down or in swimsuits fighting, on the other hand Hal is awesome!"
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"Love HAL, but missing the original three or more competitors sitting down. Felt like more fun and chilling out then this tv format. Please go back to the old format. And Do a belt match :)"
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),But you're standing... hahaha!!
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),joe and danielle are the sweetest i love them so much
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Not feeling this new format. What i loved from movie fights is that it was super casual.
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"Sorry guys, I tried I really did but the new format is no where near as engaging. The old format felt less scripted and more fun. Hal is a good judge/host and the three judge format helps keep it real. Keep those aspects of this format but go back to a table discussion with three fighters. Oh and Dan can keep his mic though the lack of headphones was jarring :)"
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"I haven’t seen The Book of Henry, but I would definitely watch Book of Henry 2:  Book Harder."
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"Blade Runner 2047 and Logan are definitely better than their choices, but I would have to chose The Big Sick over Get Out. They’re both good, but Big Sick is a bit better."
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Third fighter isn't a request....it's a priority!

prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Haven’t seen Get Out so disappointed with all the detail explained and twist. However it is my fault for not seeing it sooner but maybe put a disclaimer of the spoilers in each episode.
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"I agree, please sit down and 3 fighters. Please and Thank You."
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"Please: 3 fighters, and siting."
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"I prefer the old format, this feels too formal. The great things of movie fights was that it felt like a show of friends arguing about different movie related topics."
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),say i hate superman
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"1) Bring back three fighters
2) Let them sit down

Simple"
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"This was a little boring in comparison to old format (been watching since fight episode). Three fighters brought more energy, but three fighters also got more out of control and turned into screening matches, and good points got lost someone yelling. Really like three judges, But prefer if Roxy was actually a judge and not just a robot who reads what a poll said. love that movie fights is back, I’m looking forward to how you guys will make this format better and work"
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),what's their snapchat?
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"Yo what the hell is this passive aggressive good sportsmanship garbage? This didn’t feel like movie fights, it felt more like movie civilized debates. Bring back 3 fighters and the more laid back setting. Hal is a great host though."
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"I'm sincerely sorry, but if this is the Movie Fights format going forward, I won't be watching along anymore. This format just fells outdated and old - like a bad tv show. I'm truly sorry.

I understand the wish to get some distance from what happened with the guy who's name we do not mention, but the old format (despite its host) worked wonderfully. Afterall: most of the fanbase was even against the previous host before all of the stuff happened last year.

Please reconsider this new model!"
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"This is movie debates, not movie fights. Hope you guys find your new style and confort soon.
Recomendations? hmm. three fighters was more fun to listen. Maybe do more a ""brawl"" overall and giving the fighters points for arguments, passion, creativity, etc not for the round itself. Like 4 points per rounds. 
I don't know, just keep improving, don't overreact the hate like you always do."
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),With only two fighters I found myself rooting for neither fighter or wanting at least one more option for the majority of the video.
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"Cool that you guys are back and I guess this is some try and error thingy. Amyway. for me: too long rounds, I rather prefer to have shorter and more rounds like before. Rather have more then three fighters, not less, so this feelt a bit of. I like the more chaotic feeling when three or more ppl are discussing. Other than that, fun to see it back on air."
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Please do three fighters and sitting down!! Love that Movie FIghts are back =]
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Danielle is great!

prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Way to sanitary and restrained. Where's the FIGHT in Movie Fights? Where's the entertainment?
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Was this live?
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),More fights with Danielle and Joe. They were awesome!!!
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"Joe was an absolute star on this, his Bright rant was up with the best!"
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),I like the new format. It could use some sound cues for structure and to pump up fighters. Keep it up
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),They’re trying so hard to create funny moments but It’s just not working. There will be no shame in just going back to the old movie fights. This format is just not as entertaining
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"I'm sad that this isn't my favorite show on YouTube anymore. I miss the feel/vibe of the old version. This new version is like a game show with no prizes...what is the point? I just really liked the feeling of the old version, it felt like hanging out with friends where winning bragging rights is the point and is satisfying. I know this is only the second episode but I really hope that they will be bringing in debaters from other places than their daily show, I'm not going to say who I like and dislike (except Dan...I LOVE Dan!) but I will say that I don't want to see the same people doing all of the shows (again, except Dan, he should be in everything). I wish I could be supportive of the changes but I'm not loving it. I do like that the viewers can participate in voting even though the show airs live while I'm at work so I can't participate myself."
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"Gee, thanks for not taking any of the massive feedback left on the preview version into consideration.  RIP Movie Fights."
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"Why do the fighters have to be standing? I dont mind that theres only 2 fighters and I don't mind the new format, it's fine, but why does everyon have to be standing. Feels unnatural. Just sit down"

prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),I NEED BRIGHT SPIN OFFS!

prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"Okay, but there are a couple problems:
-Bring back 3 contestants
-Let the contestants sit down"
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Looking forward to Honest Trailers 2018 Oscar Edition! But can we also have a Razzie Edition?  Joe and the others clearly have more fun talking about bad movies.
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Steven soderbergh should direct gambit
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"Having thought about it, three judges are better. OG Movie Fights were great, the changes feel unnecessary. Overall, not a fan of the new format."
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),So I'm assuming their  friendship with Max Landis is over if they're shitting all over on Bright......... Thank God.
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"Again, love Hal as a judge, don't mind the standing but deeeeefinitely missing the third fighter. I know it becomes a bit chaotic with a third fighter, but that's where the fun is, when it goes off the rails a bit!"
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"I love joe's praise of I, Tonya"
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Bright as the worst really? Maybeo forgettable but there were so many worse films.
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Bright is clearly a let down but no where near the worst movie.
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Joe Star is dead to me now. Bright was pretty good.
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"Little things are affecting this show. The fighters and host standing up just feels awkward (it's not that the fighters can't handle it, it's the fact that we like fighters sitting down and fighting because it just feels more natural. Watching them stand is just jarring), sound is dodgy at best, you are better than this SJ."
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Does this get better? First fifteen minutes is super awkward
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),I liked the former more casual movie fights
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"This needs more graphics and sound effects... the show is too stiff... at least put a clap track, the sound of 3 claps in the background is kind of sad"
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"New format just doesn’t really work - please accept and revert, this isn’t just a ‘people don’t like change’ thing"
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Best villain was Jon Hamm in baby driver
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Where are the time stamps?
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),I really love both of the movies you guys picked. I went to see The Big Sick on a first date. Let's just say it was a good choice.
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),#buttcam
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),3 fighters was the perfect number...
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"Regardless how I feel about the new structure of this program, Roxy is a goddess now and forever."
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"I think the best of 2017 were Get Out, Logan, Wonder Woman, Dunkirk, Disaster Artist. 

This is why I miss the old format. This seemed like a high minded debate by two critics. Those two movies may have been bad, but they seemed to forget that these movies came out in 2017: Boss Baby, Emoji Movie, Transformers The Last Knight, The Mummy, another Pirates of the Caribbean, a Smurfs sequel, do I have to keep going?"
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Great try guys.  But meh
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Bright is awesome
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Good questions but the fight itself went way too clearly for Joe in my mind. Like everyone is saying third player would've made this more interesting.
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),I understand wanting to clean up movie fights (allowing people to cleanly debate movies rather than yell over one another). But I think you need a time limit for opening cases and sharing. I have to agree with the other comments I saw about getting bored within the first fight.
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"It's going to be very hard for the contestants to stand up if you decide to bring back drunk movie fights, just saying."
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"The first debate for best movie of 2017 was focused only on the social commentary of both films and while they both have powerful messages it's kind of a huge disservice to filmmaking in general to not even discuss aspects how the film was shot, how the story was told, even how the film was overall directed. Both of those films had a lot to say, and it was great to have interesting social commentary told well more than once in the span of a year but there was little to no debate on the quality of filmmaking and it was  a little disappointing because I know both panelists see a lot of movies and know a lot about filmmaking."
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),standing? that's very aggressive
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"This is not a movie fight! Taking it to two fighters makes it two people taking turns to say a monologue. You have destroyed what made this interesting. I have watched every old style movie fight and enjoyed it no matter who was on it, but the last two shows have been boring to listen to and allows no banter."
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"Yeah, I will repeat what was already said. The two player format only gives us 2 ideas and with 3 you could cover more genres/tastes/arguments. Unfortunately with 3 players you lose the clear function of the 3 judges (good change). Right now their decision cant turn into stalemate. So maybe 4 judges(add Hals opinion)? Lastly the standing, podiums and an actual host really makes this look like a cable TV show. Before it had a chill atmosphere for casual movie talk."
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Not loving the new format and use of only Screen Junkies employees. Zzzzzz
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"I don't like this new set, it's too corporate and formal. The old one was more friendly, it had nerdy stuff in the background."
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),ITS BAAACCCK
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Where are the toys????????!!!!!
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Good Movie Fights! I like those Blade Runner wall panels.
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"too clinical - only two contendants, standing up, fewer questions, the setting, the framing, the sound..."
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Feedback: Bring the podiums closer please thanks
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"Why ist this only available in 720p? This new Movie Fights looks so forced and everybody looks so tense all the time. I say stomp the whole Channel, give it a new name, give a new cool studio and relax a little."
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"Hearing Hal saying ""Dank Memes"" was priceless. So out of the blue and priceless."
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"Really glad to see it back, but I think the third fighter allows for more interesting arguments and rebuttals. The three judges format is good and Hal is a great host. I know people are harping on you guys sitting down, I just think the problem is podiums make it seem a little bit debate club and it feels less intimate and spontaneous."
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),I think three people works better. Every game show in history has at least three people. Find me one that doesn't. Don't mind the new set or format that much but it needs three people.
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),IT best movie 2017
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"I get that you want two fighters so you can fit in the yes or no questions without the awkward maybe with the third fighter, but three contestants is way more interesting. The standing makes this seem like a presidential debate, definitely changes the vibe. I'm so glad Dan and Roxy are involved though"
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),BRING BACK THE FORMER FORMAT!!!
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAASSSS
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"New host - yes!!! 
3 judges - yes!!!

The rest I have to say is lacking, 3 contenders feels like a better fit and let’s not make this into a crappy 90’s game show. Let them sit and be less formal have a laugh and be merry, not a formal robot"
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"Enjoyed the fight, glad to see this back.

I think it would be improved though if the two fighters were on the same side of the set, i.e. Switch Hal and Danielle's positions. I think that this would allow a bit more back and forth between the two competitors and also avoid the need for split sceen which I found a bit annoying."
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),3 fighters and more main questions would be so good... keep the standing whatever but we need the 3 fighters and more questions back
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"We totally understand why you made changes and I do not think anyone is against change as such but three 'fighters' all sitting down is what made it what it was.  There are already too many one on one type battle/quiz/discussion shows.  Please consider going back to the old format (sort of).  We know what happened with A**y must have really messed you up but he has gone, you have to move on.  Having a car crash generally does not stop people getting back in a car and trying again, know what I mean?  I really do not think this is about people not giving this new format a chance, i think this is just simply people telling you what made the old format of the show so special in the first place.  :-)"
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"30 fps is freaking me out. also,  dont love the new format. liked the old more conversational style. love 3 judges though."
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Let’s see for me the best movie of 2017 i have to go with my little pony the movie 🎥🍿🦄
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"The new format just isn't doing it for me. Feels far more formal, restricted and kinda dull. The round table format with 3 fighters was more scrappy, chaotic and just much more fun."

prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),They seem like they are running for a political charge which is no a good thing at all. Please listen to your viewers and accept that this format (2 fighters standing up) is not the best choice for the show.
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"Haven't watched for a long time due to not liking the old host (before the scandal), but i enjoyed the old format, the only issue was having 1 judge... 3 judges is good idea, but the old format is better than this, no offence but this was boring :) Cheers."
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Format is great but what a dull fight
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),dont know why but this comes across as really flat
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"This format could work, but you need some non-buddy fighters!"
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Please brng back a third fighter! That way chances are higher that people know at least some of the tings that are argued about. In this episode I was unable to really enjoy the first three rounds because I have only seen ONE of the movies being argued about.
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Hehe...Joe starr... Joseph joestar..hehe JoJo reference
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"Come on guys.. I get the whole new look approach, but the old format was great, and the more laidback feel of ""friends discussing movies"" is kind of the essence of moviefights. You don't need to make it this formal to keep it about the discussion.."
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Thanks so much for spoiling Get Out for everyone who hasn't seen it yet.
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),But... I liked Bright
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"Tried to give this move fights a go, watched all episode love dans new position as the guy who breaks down arguments but both jo and Danielle’s Arguments were so poor, that’s why dan is the best fighter as he gets in the mindset of picking at a film even if it’s his favourite film, also Hal questions were great but 2 fighters and how formal it feels now is so poor, I get you don’t want it to b the same as before but surely there is other changes you could do"
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),This is essentially no different from John campeas movie debate show on the AMC channel. It failed for a reason guys.. It's not fun
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"Whether or not you like the 3 contestant dynamic, it really helps the silence during the fights."
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),this is....different....😕
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"Not down with the underground, more competitors"
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),This isn't my movie fights...bring the old format back
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),3 fighters and chairs. Hal rocks
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),I'd like to hear Hals thoughts on the arguments more often. I say to always go to the audience poll last.
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Finally Movie Fights is back!
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"change is hard, but sometime necessary for growth. Give them time to get comfortable with the format they've created before they go about making any major changes to it. Keep in mind that the old set up and format might be something that effects them emotionally, that they can't disassociate from the vile human being that created it."
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Can we talk about that Max Landis burn?
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"Not a fan of the new set, preferred the more casual setting, this looks like a game show or political debate set."
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"Try to hear Villeneuve in french  ...  for me sounds great
 Gillespie , DJ Qualls in The New Guy  changed Gillespie to Gill ... coz it sound cooler"
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Needs three fighters. Desperately
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),I like the 2 fighters I think it gives time for better arguments
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"Glad you're back!

However, why did you change the format? If it is not broken don't fix it"
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Glad to see movie fights back but 3 fighters please.... great job guys
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Guys please add the 3 person.
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),yoo gotta bring back the 3rd players! BUT IM SO GLAD MOVIE FIGHTS IS BACK! Looking forward to a new year with you guys
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"I do not particularly mind the two fighter format. However, with only two fighters, it is much easier for the fights to lose steam if the fighters are too friendly or lack aggression, as happened in the first round here. However, I think as long as the more formal nature of this format is embraced, and both fighters are eager to attack, this can be a just as successful and fun as the old movie fights."
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"Why is it that only critics hate Bright? Literally 27 on rotten tomatoes from critics, 87 by the audience. Talk about a disconnect."
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"I'm really happy to have Movie Fights back. What I like about the new format is what a lot of people don't like: the two fighters. I agree with some that the third fighter kept things more intense and interesting because you could have an argument pulled in a lot of different directions, but I'm also a guy that liked the civil fights more than the chaotic fights. Three fighters would sometimes become too much of a circus.

That being said, two fighters does feel very formal. This isn't always a bad thing. We have the potential of getting into deeper arguments when people are nice, civil, and taking turns. What was really amazing in this fight was how much fun you could see Danielle and Joe having. Two fighters keep them focused just on the other player and that produces some great moments.

I love the show and even with a lot of people clamoring for three fighters, you've created a great format that works. Also, Hal is great and I love his little challenges like the rant and the song. Great work, Hal."
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"Its called movie fight, not movie debats let free foam talk . Btw. Love u guys"

prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Why is Roxy Stryer not the host???
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"Get Out? Best movie of the year? Really?!? I swore I thought these were movie buffs.. If M Night Shamy did that exact same movie, no one would have thought twice about it. 
And, yes, 3 fighters please"
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"What I have always loved about Movie Fights is the casual kitchen table approach you used to have. A group of people sitting around the table discussing things they're passionate about unabashedly. Right now this all seems so wooden and not natural. It's lost its heart, bring back the casual table, not formal podiums. Hal needs to loosen up too, i used to love him, but it just feels like nobody doing this right now is passionate about it. It all feels so hollow. Dunno, not a fan, maybe will be better in a few months when everybody's not 'talking on eggshells' anymore."
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Dont like new look of the set
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),3 fighters ! plz
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Love it guys!
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),I love all of this. My only suggestion would be having a third fighter so it's more of a conversation than game show.
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),3 fighters please
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"Nice to see you back Movie fights!, I thing though, could you bring back the clapping track? It feels weird every time that someone win and no track happens xd"

prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),I hope they have more Title fights this year. Maybe once a competitor reaches 3 or 5 wins they can challenge for the title?!

prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"love hal as a host and the new voting system, 2 players is fine as well but having everyone stand at podiums was a bad idea..its film buffs talking movies not a presidential debate. comes across as way too formal and a little awkward :/ still commend them for changing things up, think that's just one step too far"

prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"Hot take: I like the 2 fighters thing. With 3 fighters half the time it just devolved into a screaming match where no real arguments were presented, it was just who can yell their point the loudest. Now we can actually hear some real arguments, and you can hear actual counter arguments."
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"This new format is fine with me. I did enjoy the 3 fighter format a little bit more, but as this fight progressed, I found myself enjoying it more and more.

This also has to do with the fighters. Joe and Danielle seemed a bit timid in the first round, but really hit their stride in the second and third rounds.

Overall, this is one of my favorite shows to watch on Youtube. I love all the content you put out and the noticeable effort you put into this video as well as the rest of your content."
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"Hal is doing great, no complaints there. Two fighters are ok for a championship or rivalry, but it needs to go back to three fighters asap!"
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),should have kept the old format with andreyko hosting
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"I like this new format. I actually get to hear and understand the different points of view, and there isn't as much yelling! Much more interesting from a film critiquing point of view, so keep up the great work, and don't listen to all the haters here who want more fighters. They are WRONG!"
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"I just don't understand why they're doubling down on this new format.  This is not an improvement on what you were doing before, so what's the point?  To remove Andy's fingerprints from movie fights?  It's HIS creation so it will always be his show. This is an exercise in futility. No more hipster presidential debates and return to original format, please."
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"I didn't like Get Out, there I said it!  It was boring and predictable"
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"It's not the fact that they're ""standing"" so much, it's that it looks way too formal. I loved the old version where three players could bounce off each other. It was awesome when the show went off the rails. Even the set seems too formal. I always thought of movie fights as a friendly conversation that just happens to be a debate. I'm so happy movie fights is back and hopefully they can work out the kinks"
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"It's like 97% percent of the comments are about asking SJ to have the old format back (3-man fighters,sitting down). Same thing can be seen in the comments in the last movie fights. Come on guys, if ""we wouldn't be here without you guys"" statement from you is still true, THEN GIVE US WHAT WE WANT. Does that pervert licensed that old format for himself so you can't use it anymore?????????"
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Love the new format. I hated how people yelled over each in the old.
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),3 fighters.. and let the folks sit down.. let them relax!
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Have them sitting on couches. I know it's not comfortable to stand for a couple of hours. Switch Hal with Joe Starr or Roxy.
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Hal is such a fantastic and fun host.
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"Maybe I’ll get used to it all, but PLEASE sort the audio. Gotta turn it up to 70% volume and then RIP headphone users any time there’s an advert. We can’t hear a lot of anything that’s said"

prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Bring back the third fighter. It makes the game much more fun when you can have the dynamic of more than two people.
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"Sorry, I have to give a dislike just for putting Bright as the worst movie. I mean, it wasnt great, but worst? Not even close."
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"I'm so, so, so happy that movie fights are continuing. I was really sad they would discontinue, but I'm thrilled to see they're still going on. I love Hal as a host, love that the fan vote counts (even though I'm never able to watch live because of life), and really like the new stage and format. Excited to continue watching!"

prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"Good job Screenjunkies! You have made an awesome show that keeps what was fun about Movie Fights, and have gotten rid of alot of the things that seemed to be more about ego and being focused on one person's opinion. So, nice work. Hopefully they will be happening weekly :0"
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),I freakin love Joe and Danielle they are hilarious
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"I've been looking for an excuse to watch Get Out (AKA waiting for anyone to watch it with me, because it didn't seem like a watch alone movie). When Danielle was about to spoil the big twist (thanks for the warning), I hit pause and left for work, then invited a friend over and basically tricked them (not really, I said it was a critically acclaimed horror movie, which it is, I just left the options for what else to watch purposely limited) into watching Get Out with me. Now I have seen it and it's not overhyped. Now to resume watching Movie Fights. 
Thanks for cornering me into having to finally get around to seeing that film. It was great, in an unsettling sort of way."

worst was probably fifty shades and best was probably logan though i have a soft spot for baby driver"
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Joe should've pick Jordan Peele as best director. It would've fucked with Danielle's brain and pushed it to sudden death.
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"Yeah, I miss the action figures and the fact that I keep thinking how less comfortable and much more on the spot the fighter are standing up."
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"The standing behind podium's thing doesn't work... feels too formal which doesn't suit the content. The old had more like a ""bunch of friends at a bar"" vibe with someone looking in and judging the conversation, which is why I liked it.
If you don't want people sitting around a table, what about a giant half circle couch or armchairs or similar.
Having said that 3 fighters could be dominated by one loud personality - a stronger moderator could have manged that better."
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"these are so boring now, i used to watch every single week but now im only watching these in short segments"
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"I really like this new format. My only complaints are that I do miss the table. The sight of seeing 4+ people huddled around a table talking over each other about movies was a huge part of why I love movie fights. This just feels a bit too formal for me. Not enough to not watch, I still love the Screen Junkies and this is definitely still entertaining. I just think it'd be a bit better if you added one person and one table. That being said, let's address the thing on everyone's mind...

Are those panels on the wall the same ones in Deckard's apartment in the first Blade Runner?"
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"The thing is that the 3 fighters format was more entertaining because Screen Junkies used to bring two ""serious"" fighters and one ""comic relief"". That was the best part of it. Also, I can't accept the fighters standing. It suits the name ""movie fights"" better, because it has a competitive feel, but (for me) the best part of it was the whole discussion, I never cared about the winner."

prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),I know everyone else has said this as well but the two players standing feels way too uptight and not as fun as the relaxation of the table. It felt like we were sitting with y'all arguing about movies while now it just feels like y'all are debating for a government position and we are the bored constituents.

prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"Bright wasn't that bad of a movie, the elements introduced were fine and I liked the interplay between the characters. Where it fell down was that it introduced too much mythology in a 2 hr movie as it tried to be a cross between LOTR and Harry Potter."
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"Everyone complaining about the new format, please see Dan's tweet. It clears up their NEED for change."
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Happy to see movie fights is back! I prefer the 3 contestants and them sitting down. It just seemed a bit more chill and not like I was watching a tv game show. Plus having a 3rd wild card guest that could be a movie celebrity or whatever was always fun. However this is just the beginning. Change can be uncomfortable. Welcome back you guys! #RudnickWave
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"Three judges is the best change. But three contestants was more interesting, and keeping the judge to the side rather than the middle to make it feel more like friends having a great argument rather than a debate."

prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),I wonder if Max Landis watched this episode.
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"First, my thoughts on your choices:
-THE BIG SICK: 9/10
-GET OUT: 7/10
-THE BOOK OF HENRY: 3/10
-BRIGHT: 5/10
-I haven't seen I TONYA.
-I'd say all the villains in GET OUT are equally good. I wouldn't say that ROSE stands out.
-Denis Villeneuve's directing was good, but I wouldn't say it was among the best of the year.

Now, my personal picks:
-Best movies: DUNKIRK, THE LEGO BATMAN MOVIE and A SILENT VOICE.
-Worst movies: FALLEN, THE NUT JOB 2, RINGS and UNDERWORLD 5.
-Best villains: THE MAN IN BLACK from THE DARK TOWER, PHILIP KRAUSS from DETROIT and KEVIN WENDELL CRUMB from SPLIT.
-Oscar for Best Director: My nominees would be Rian Johnson, Christopher Nolan, Ruben Ostlund and Edgar Wright... and Nolan would be my winner."
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),How much were you paid to claim Bright as the worst movie? That means the Emoji movie was better...?
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Go back to the original setup with 3 fighters and...DRUNK MOVIE FIGHTS
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"A sitting 3 way is better, this is just weird, far too formal, just sit 3 fighters on a sofa...The set and mechanics were not the problem you needed to address... I stopped watching half way through, video quality is poor too, camera quality is not smooth.... on the plus side; SJU is just perfect these days!"
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),New format. I would hope for maybe 3 people but besides that let’s see how this goes. I’m excited and very curious
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"Not a fan of only 2 combatants format and the debate stage. I think the old format worked well. It wasn't perfect, but a few tweaks could've improved it and made it felt different. I just think it's a boring format with only two people.  I'm personally not a fan of Hal. It's not his ability, just not a fan. I'd rather have Dan as a host, but he's too valuable in debating to be hosting. I still support you guys and the work you do, but where I was always looking forward to the Movie Fights, I'm not really that engaged and willing to watch it ASAP."
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Bright was good.

Please bring back:
-The old studio
-People sitting around the table
-More chill show (loved drunk movie fights)
-And of course THREE fighters!"
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"First of all, I love screen junkies for really long time so I'm not here to troll or hate. I understand everything Dan wrote and I'm with you on searching new formats for MF.

But this is also why I need to write this: current idea doesn't work for me, like at all. MF was always more like a passionate discussion club at one table. Almost like ""Who's line is it anyway"" - points did not matter for me. I loved to listen to Dan's, Spencer's, Joe's, Andreyko's arguments. I loved to listen to Alicia Malone, or Roth, or Danielle. There was discussion, there was argument, there was passion and fire (Rocca vs Mantz for life!).

Now it is more like Movie Figths dressed up to be variation of Movie Games. This is not discussion, this is just two people showing off, throwing statements at each other, with funny guy in the middle who's main goal is to be funny (and you are Hal, just it is not how it should be in MF). Movie Games are/were cool but as a 20 min entertainment. MF were always so, so, so much more than this. When you got into argument like the one over TFA or Jurrasic World - for me it could last one hour, just for this one point and it was hell of a show! All of you always complained ""omg, we're 1,5 in!"" or ""omg, we're almost 2h""! I watched (literally) every MF since it came out and I always thought: MF longer = MF better and more fun.

Even the interactions between contestants were better. When you show both players now on split screen it has less emotional impact, they can be even in different places/sets for all I know. And this strange TV-game-show vibe which is not (in my opinion) a good thing for MF.

Sorry to say all this, I really wanted to like new direction but I can't falsely praise it just for the praise. Please think of something different than original MF (I understand your need to do so) but maybe somehow closer to that format, not closer to corky, awkward TV game show.

Sincerely, your fan for ages

prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"49:58
Problem with her song is that no one in the movie seemed to actually hate black people. They were being liberal racists, looking to commodify black people because of racist views about the superiority of black bodies and what they considered the fad of black culture. Funny though."
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"I feel like standing makes it harder for them to make better answers. I noticed they had to use an Um after each of their reveal answers. Also the two man face off will make it easy for one person to dominate. I think to make the stakes interesting, at least 3 need to be present so everyone has to be mindful of the person they spent less attention towards. Also, it is harder to get heated if it isn't a group discussion. Ascetically, the separating of the participants makes this look more like a less intimate and friendly competition. Also, there is no nerdy crap on the set. Generally, this looks like a less fun version of Movie Fights."
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"I know what is missing. Audience, reactions from the audience. In the old format from the four people at the table at least one of them behaved like the audience would."
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Idk about everyone else but my favorite parts are hearing everyone’s answer to the questions. So id say add more contestants.
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"I’d really encourage people to read Dan’s twitter post regarding the whole ‘back to the old format!’ moans.

Either way I look forward to more fighting in the future!"

2. Emoji movie (although I haven't seen that movie)
3. Vulture"
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"I guess the biggest thing I missed on the old format is the unproduced feel it had. The interruptions, the outbursts of the competitors. The ""formal"" format works if you really want to count the points but on the entertainment value, it doesn't work that well. When Joe Starr is on the roster before, everyone is already expecting a weird and very entertaining fight. At this one he seemed to be too prepped. Also, the passion on the argument is not expressed so much because of the ""formal"" format.

It's the 2nd episode of course. The entertainment factor might kick in once the fighters get used to the format. Bring on more unruly fights! :D

prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"As someone who’s been with Screen Junkies since the beginning, since Hal was interviewing people who didn’t like the Avengers, I’m not a fan of this new movie fights. SJ has probably been my biggest influence for watching films so I say this in the most constructive way possible.

We need 3 fighters; yes, someone will get a crappy answer more than likely but that’s the fun part of movie fights - when Nick Mundy argues for Jackass 2 and wins, that’s what makes this show special. 

Have them sit down - yes, I know they can stand for an hour or two, but it makes the show more formal and less like the hangout everyone enjoys. It’s less like the family we know and love. When your friend is standing in your house, it’s uneasy and offputting. When the contestants sit down, it feels like we’re all just having a chat (even the audience). It’s more light-hearted, relaxed and fun. 

I get it, Andy destroyed and ruined the channels reputation; it’s hard for people to get back on board after what happened. I know we’re trying to make things different with the graphics and format. I’m not against change; add new shows and pieces to the SJ brand. Its just that this show doesn’t feel like the one I fell in love with. I know the comment doesn’t mean much but this channel still has my favorite people."

prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),I love the changes. I stopped watching movie fights after a while because it became so difficult to listen to Andy and his judging. So loving the three judges (even though the audience generally doesn't get the concept of judging argumentation and not picking their favorite movie)
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),To be fair max Landis most likely got taken off of writing because assault allegations not because it was bad.
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),I love that Movie fights is back! I appreciate that you guys try different things. But I hope you can bring 3 fighters back.

prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),I appreciate what Screen Junkies is trying to do in not having a show so close to what was done why Andy was there but I'm not crazy on this new format. It's very slow and too organised. I preferred when it became a bit of a nerd fest and we had more energy. This feels like movie discussions and not movie fights. Please consider retooling it a bit. Having 3 people would definitely be a step in the right direction.
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"Great job Hal! No lie though, the old format was a perfect chaos . You already fixed the problem with the judges and host but everything else before was great"

And villain?  It may be mainstream, but Michael Keaton's Vulture worked for Joe Starr's lead in far better than Tonya Harding.  That and referring to an artistic depiction of a real person as a villain is a bit off as well."
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"I like the new format, first time I’ve ever watched the entire show. Plus now that there’s only two fighters we actually get to hear the arguments better and in more depth"

prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"Granted, I know that for him it's opposite, but I appreciated when Roxy said upper right corner and Dan pointed to the left. 😂😂"
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Oh wow look at this comment section. Actual good feedback and arguments! What a nice change of pase! This fanbase is awesome.

prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Still hatin' the two player format. It feels so slow and lot less dynamic. Not as much fun.
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Can you please do Don Jon?
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"Should be three fighters sitting, no popular vote.  Sorry, the old format was much better, the atmosphere was just better and the debates much more fun"
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"I don't really understand the hate for Bright.
I liked it."
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),I like the new format but why are there only 2 fighters?
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),It would be awesome if they could sit......and be more fighters.
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Bring back three person fights!!!But glad the show is back!
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Please bring back 3 fighters and the desk.  This feels like some kind of game show now and this isn't what we wanted.
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Thank you Joe for someone finally not kissing Max Landis' ass on here.
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"More questions, shorter debate times."
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"If you're going to put ads in the video (I truly don't mind) is it possible to put them somewhere that's not in the middle of an argument?

Also Logan Lucky was the worst movie of 2017...."
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"man,  movie fights never put me to sleep until now."
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),lol why's everyone obsessing over whether the contestants sit or stand
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"Movie fights is fighting about movies, I love all y’all and I love the new format, because it’s still movie fights with screenjunkies & friends
Ppl need to accept change bc these changes are made to improve this really fun way to talk movies
<3"
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Oh and I think some quiet music might make this feel a little more polished?
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"Hal is an excellent host, the perfect choice. Danielle and joe were super fun fighters to watch.
 I think I´ll get used to this setup very quickly, really enjoying the new movie fights and the on-screen text being only on the bottom half of the screen is definitely better now than in the last one!"
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Add the 3rd competitor please
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),MOOOOVIE FIGHHHTSSS!
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"Just needs another fighter, and let them sit down"
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"Bright is bad because the core concept is flawed, it doesn't matter if it had ""good action"" if the whole movie is based on a racist premise. At least Zootopia managed to hide the questionable undertones behind good writing and characters."
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),If you think Baby Driver is the best movie of 2017 you shouldn't be allowed to watch movies anymore.
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Hal's a great host
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"Uhh I don't think it was because of the movie that they dismissed Max Landis from the sequel, I'm guessing it's the sexual assault allegations."
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),The Worst film of 2017 has to be Bright
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"I agree with the sitting down, and the three fighters comments, but most of all, please don't give the poll a vote."
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),To me the best movie of 2017 is the Disaster Artist
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),I want them to bring back the three person format
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"Also, a production thing...the cold colors of the background really do not go well with the aggressive tone of the show."
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"I agee, three fighters are needed. Do it standing and with this set, whatever. But have three fighters, this is a bit dull."
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"I loves me a bit of Danielle BUT dammit women!!! I missed watching Get Out whilst it was out in theatres and have been patiently waiting for it to pop up on a streaming service for the past year. Ive even managed to dodge any spoilers....up until today when I watch Movie Fights and I’ve had to turn it off after round 3 because you’ve already ruined half the movie!!! ☹️

Lucky for me today’s premiere on NowTV just so happens to be.....Get Out!!!  (If only I had checked before watching Movie Fights 🤦🏻‍♂️)

Side note: I actually don’t mind the new formate, 1 great host!, 2 fighters can give more detailed arguments, 3 judges makes it more fair and you’re always bloody sat down, stretch those legs, it’s all good.

However I do think this new format has made it feel too formal and less like a group of friends having a chat/rant about films which is what most people are missing. But I’m sure you’ll iron out the kinks as you go on. Much love from a long time fan #ImAScreenJunkie"
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),And that sound is rough.
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"I'm glad you guys are making changes but this doesn't feel relaxed. It might just be growing pains, who knows. Keep up the good work guys!"
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"The set is so quiet, it just makes the stutters and pauses more akward. Try some ambient music or something."
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"Three players, sitting!"
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Return to 3 contestants and sitting down format please.
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),I really do agree with everyone else where I wish there was still 3 competitors. I don't really care about them sitting down or not. Get them a stool. Lol
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),:( first fight and I am bored. :(
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Enjoyed the fight. Might want to work on the mic placement. Since they're looking at each other as they talk they're not talking into the mic a lot of the time.
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),3 fighters please.  I wonder if Kevin Smith would stand for an hour lol.
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"Damn, I don't think Max Landis is coming back to movie fights after this one XD"
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Yeah movie fights!!
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"Lot of love for the new format? I just heard that read with Donalds voice. The new format is boring af, 3 fighters and more fights pls. There was nothing wrong with the old format, don't fix what ain't broken."
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),I literally smiled all the way through this video. Thanks guys.
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"I like this format. Also, why aren't Joe and Danielle a couple yet?"
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Goddamit all these people are so charming how can you not love the screen junkies?
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),68 minute video and i watched it in 15 minutes or so.Sorry guys but this was boring.I was getting tired of the whole movie fights thing even before the thing with Andy.I really think that you should either return to the old format or just drop it completely and bring back flick bait it was really creative and fun
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"I’ll have to echo most of the comments I’ve read. I KNOW we hate change even when it’s good. I know I’m biased against new. I KNOW.

But...

We connected more with the other format because it felt like the impromptu arguments that we as movie fans have at home.

This doesn’t feel like that and it’s, at least for me, harder to engage"
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),whats with the shitty vid quality
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Ugh I was hoping they took time off to go back top the old set. This set is so bland and generic
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),How dare you say bright was the worst!?!?
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"i like it much more with 2 fighters, because i find it much better to follow, less muddled up. Sometimes with 3 fighters, one just got lost. and i couldn't care less if they sit or stand. also nice work with improving the voting system!"
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Bout time 😎
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"4:20 fight begins (yes, really)  also have them sit down, if you could, and rather have 3 fighters, but maybe that is just me."
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"Movies that came out in 2017 worse than Bright or The Book of Henry: Transformers 5, The Emoji Movie, Let There Be Light, The Bye Bye Man, Boo 2! A Madea Halloween, Geostorm, The Snowman... Need I go on?"
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Well... I am impressed. I didn't like Hal very much... too noisy for me. But as a judge? He is leagues above what Andy used to be. Though I must agree that 3 contestants were better. But it's great to see Movie Fights back =) Missed it so much
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Head to head bouts should always be kept for championship fights. You can't hold an hour show with one strong fighter and a weak one.  3 fighters for regular fights and 2 for title fights. Welcome back!
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"I'm usually not the guy who cares about this, but... why no 1080p?"
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Can you imagine Drunk Movie Fights in this format? I dont. (I guess good old movie fights wont come back). Great hosting by Hal though.
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"As many have said: 3 competitors sitting down, 2 judges (none the live audience), and Hal breaks any ties. Love Hal as the host!!!"
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Is that a Breezango shirt Joe Starr was wearing?
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Danielle and Joe were fantastic! I'm glad they brought the energy
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"Danielle displayed a real lack of movie knowledge this episode, and I her arguments for get out weren't too great. But that's something I've felt from her on the news channel at times (I'm still convinced she hasn't sat down and watched all 3 punisher movies just for being punisher movies) 

About the format easy mode now would be ""make a really good modern answer to pander to the audience vote""... Audience votes have always sucked 
If we are sticking to 2 contestants and 3 judges, let each judge score on a category... Especially as Hal throwing in random ""sing a song/give a rant"" really benefits certain fighters....
Also 3 questions doesn't allow funny random weird answers to come into play as much anymore, Dan being my favourite fighter then that's a plus, Mike being my second it's a con.  

 I don't know this episode was a bit meh 

(that said I did enjoy Dan vs Spencer...fueled by there styles and conflict I guess)"
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"How no one used ""Wish Upon"" for worst movie I will not understand.  I mean no one saw it but it happened."
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Holy fuck it's back YAAAAAAAS
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"Screen Junkies: You have a huge fan base who loves the talent you have over there. We love your content but I would seriously consider listening to some of these comments. I understand your strong feelings for the format change (Dan's tweet) but the reality is this show works far better as that ""3 buddies arguing random stuff about movies"" in a relaxed atmosphere which so many of your viewers can relate to in their own lives. Good choice with judges and Hal hosting, but hoping you won't be too prideful and make some changes which most people would love..."
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),I love that both of their best villain choices were women
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"Dont let the actions of one man destroy what we all love. And I know you won't but listen to the feedback, you are doing this for the fans no?"
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Whats going on with SJ? It seems like every argument is either about race or gender instead of the actual filmmaking.
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),This is dreadful I'd rather not have movie fights at all than this
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"Since I mostly listen to the show, the standing vs. sitting thing doesn’t bother me at all. I like Hal’s energy and his thoughtful questions. I’m also not super upset about two fighters instead of three. In the old format, there would sometimes be a third fighter who didn’t get to speak up as much and that would be awkward. So I don’t mind the changes overall. I think the show will find its rhythm. Maybe it just doesn’t seem super dynamic to some people because they haven’t brought in outside fighters yet. Love you guys! Keep going!"
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),I thought Bright was good; may be i am poor in taste.#buttcam
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"I get why you're not doing it the same cause it'll remind people of Andy, I get it. But did you have to change it so much? In structure and format? I mean, it being three people was great, the podcast style format was a lot better, this is way too game showy. It being sorta casual was what made it fun, it felt like you were just watching friends argue about movies and it worked. I mean, there are major elements of it here for damn sure, but hope y'all are taking things into account."
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Thank you Hal! i know it must be tough to take over but movie fights must live on!
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"I find it a bit weird that Joe slammed Max Landis that much, knowing that he was a longlasting friend of the show and Screen Junkies in general."
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Please bring back Scott Mantz and John Rocha screaming at each other.
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"The good: Hal was a great host, loved seeing Dan more involved, 3 judges was a great idea, and I liked the new graphics/set. Very nice.
The Bad: It seems a little too nice/ formal for a movie fight, and you really, really need to have 3 fighters! Oh and please let them sit again."
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Can't watch this new format
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),I only have ONE thing to say #NotMyMovieFights  and the Worst movie of 2017 was BABY DRIVER
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),This is awful
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Who should be the next Wolverine? Kellan Lutz
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),I would rather have it go back to one judge and three on the panel. It is more interesting having a 3-way debate versus 3 judges. This gameshow look is stale and looks so 1980s. I feel like I'm watching the price is right.
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"Oh wow, I have to say I was on the fence regarding this new format, but I feel like Hal is getting better and better (and I'm saying that after only 2 episodes) and the fighters are also starting to get more familiar with the format.
I laughed out loud at around @49:00 when Danielle had to sing. That was priceless and if we're doing another ""best of the past year in movie fights"", this needs to be included IMO.

Keep up the great job guys, looking forward to the further development of this show. :)"
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Wow thanks for the get out spoiler warning😒 lol
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),I really liked the old movie fights. I will try though
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),You guys were being way too nice to each other. We know you’re friends… It’s OK if you want to debate passionately.
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"so will Max Landis not be on Screen Junkies after that savage thrashing, or will he be a good sport and realise his mistakes?"
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Previous set and system of 3 competitors was way cooler honestly
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Hey Joe And Danielle... please do a WWE/Wrestling Review show... i mean it is on a screen so i think ScreenJunkies can cover it... Anybody else want this or is it just me?
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Can we go back to the old Format please!?
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Great show guys! I like the new lightning and the removal of the sidebar graphic. I'm curious to see how this new format is going to evolve in the upcoming months.
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Vast improvement over the pilot episode.
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"Hal, i'm in love with you!"
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),There's tons of black people that are racist
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),I miss the old movie fights
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Wearing a Breezango shirt? He’s got my vote!
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"Bright was not perfect, but it wasn't bad either. It was just OK. Decent for a Netflix production. Come on guys!"
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),when are y'all going back to the good movie fights with three sitting people?
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"So racism , racism , racism"
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),I 2as waiting for the voice guy to answer the contestants and tell what prizes they were playing for. This felt like a game show not movie fights
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"Not sure if this question has ever been done, but I would love to hear a battle (Actually 2 separate ones) What is a better film Die Hard or Lethal Weapon? & then go onto what is a better franchise Die Hard or Lethal Weapon."
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"Please bring back the third fighter, it's WAY more dynamic."
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Its more fun to have more  Moviefighters defend more Movies giving more insight in our favorite Movies and discover even more ones
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Please bring back the 3 fighters
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),#buttcam
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Still too formal guys
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),You know what's missing? All those geeky posters in the background and toys! I liked this fight more than I thouht though! Great content!
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"I understand changes needed to be made, but losing the 3rd fighter really saps some of the energy out the show"
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"Glad to see the show is back! I love the new format, and 2 competitors makes more sense than 3, esp with questions phrased ""yes no"" or ""good/bad"".
Just gotta bring back the heat, it's gotten very formal, prob just finding the rhythm again."
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"For me, and probably for most of the other hardcore MF fans, it was always about the atmosphere of the fight, which was informal, friendly, but many times also heated. This reminds us of movie fights we would have with our own friends, but sometimes we wouldn't have the company or the knowledge to do it.
This is not good... And its a pity, because you have all the right ingredients. It's not that I'm hating it just because it's different. But it's just so far away from what it could be. Do you really want Movie Fights to be this official and 1 on 1 all the way through? For me, the third opinion is what made it interesting. Instead of a simple, dry, two-way debate, you have a brawl. Putting two fighters against each other makes it more a quiz show."
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Really enjoyed it but 3 fighters works better and produces the best comedic moments.
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"Overall I like the new format. I just wish sometimes Hal toned it down a little bit. I think he's funny and I like him hosting, but it seems like he has to throw a silly question in every round and I just think it'd be better used a little more sparingly."
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Change the name to Agenda movie fights.
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),I think the new format is better in every way. Two thumbs up.
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),i actually liked bright.....
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"Okay, if you do these changes better change the name as well. Movie Debates."
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"Credit for trying something different, but I think it had significantly more energy with three fighters sat around a desk. This feels kind of stuffy where it used to be fun. It used to feel, to me, like hanging out with a bunch mates having fun arguing daft things about films, now it feels like watching a debate about infrastructure spending in a sleepy southern state. Other than the host, it wasn't broke, what were you fixing?"
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"Bright was mediocre but fun. No way it was worse than actually bad movies like Emoji, Baywatch, Mummy, Dark Tower, Transformers, etc."
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Please bring back flick bait I loved that show
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Good fight! Actually like this new format more!
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"This was BULLSH*T! How did Danielle win?!! She's clearly only seen Get Out and a couple of other movies this year, she was just joking about it to cover her tracks. She fooled you all!"

prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),I think if its possible 3 fighters and each podium would be better not just red and blue(politically charged) each fighter could have their own design with their name on for example
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Yes! Movie fights! I missed it so much!
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"It's not that I think humans are incapable of standing for an hour, it's that it looks uncomfortable and stiff. I do appreciate the show though, and hope that it still gets tweaked etc."
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),I am so glad Movie fights is back!!!
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"According to everyone but moron critics, Bright was actually a good movie. More people probably watched it than your best movie picks."
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"Wow, the amount of misinformation Joe is spreading about Bright is ludicrous. Feels like were not going to see Max on ScreenJunkies anytime soon. Maybe you have to be a US American to hate Bright. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯"
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"Great to have the show back,
Like the format
Prefer 3 competitors,
Hall as host is super
Like the 3 judge system 
Keep it coming"
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"Have to ask again this year. Are there spoilers for movies such as Lady Bird, Call Me By Your Name and others not available in Europe yet?"
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Bright is actually a good film I don't get all the hate
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"3 fighters was more fun, it really allowed for people to build off of one another, ganging up against the really obvious choices and made it more interesting.

Hal is a great judge, and really happy to have movie fights back"
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),I want that wacky third
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Was the mlp movie mentioned just asking
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"Good to have this back, but a 3 fighter format creates more setups for comedy. Love y'all"
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Time stamps or I bounce.
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Wayyyy to formal. The podcast feel is way better.
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"I'm going to say this. I still love The Book of Henry. Great character acting. The kind of movies I wish Spielberg was still making with family and adventure and just a little tonal nonsense. I stand by it. I had so much fun at that movie I saw it twice. Also, that movie poster is dope as hell!"
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Process and the frog next
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),I dont care if they are standing but bring back the table please. Said someone who is actually going to watch Movie Fights anyway because this show is AWESOME
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"I _love_ the wall panels, but you could improve the acoustics just a little bit."
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),I like it. 3 fighters would be better though imo. hal is a great moderator and the judge system is solid too !
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"Old format was better. 3 fighter sitting down seemed more chill and fun than this. This look too profesional. 3 judges is great though, that way one cant just say what he wants and overrule everyone else"
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Like the old format better than this game show style. I like it when it was a group debate not a one on one
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),What about the emoji movie
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"I just can't get used to this new format. I like the different judges, but I don't like anything else. I'll give it a couple more viewings, but I don't expect to stick around, and I really used to love the old format. Also, I guess no more drunk movie fights with the reigning champ Ken Napzok. :( this format would be terrible for drunk movie fights, I don't think anyone would be standing halfway through."
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),you should still have 3 contestants
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Is T.V. Fights coming back... also Comic Fights?
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),please bring back the stools!!! its way to fomal. Hal is a great host!!
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Big six and get out? :D Would rather make my worst list. But hey. Cant argue taste. And bright and Henry worst? Again. Quite the opposite. Maybe i am just too old ^^
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),i want 3 figthers
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"Joe missed the opportunity to talk about how The Big Sick subverted the Romcom genre to create an unconventional love story that is grounded and relatable but most importantly enjoyable. When Harry Met Sally is celebrated because it pioneered the genre, The Big Sick transcended it."
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"I just find Joe so unfunny, he's trying way too hard to be funny and he just isn't."
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"Am I legit the only one who does like this new format? Yeah I think the addition of a 3rd fighter would return this to the old ways, making it a bit more of a fight than a debate, but this format is good!"
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"This feels more ""Dan"" Movie Fights and we need more ""Spencer"" Movie Fights, less professional, more fun... But for the love of good, don't go ""Joe"" Movie Fights ...."
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),do a videogame version
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"I like the new format, but I would love to see 3 contestants and let them have stools to sit on or tall chairs.."
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"IF everything is different but the name of the show, should this still be called movie fights?"
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"Scrap the podiums, Bring in couches ;) Always saw Movie Fights as more of a living room game than a game show."
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Let’s see for me the best movie of 2017 i have to go with my little pony the movie 🎥🍿🦄
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"While I have not always loved Hal, I really enjoy his energy here. Though I wish he wouldn’t try to mandate a particular fight style (ie. Give me an angry rant). Let the fighters fight their own fight."
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Bright the worst movie ? We must’ve watched different movies then 😐
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"3>2
3 people was more intresting and sitting was not so forced"
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),renamed to movie discussions not movie fights
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"I still dislike Hal's tangents. They're usually really childish and almost too silly... It's ok to ask them to elaborate, but to say ""hey for sh*ts and giggles, sing and dance for a point."
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Bright was a likable movie.
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Like everything except for the standing and number of combatants. I honestly preferred the format before
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),nice breezango shirt joe!
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Worst movie was Jeepers Creepers 3! But I guess nobody saw it :D
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"The two fighters are charming and funny, ""most adorable movie fights ever."" I enjoyed this, especially when they got to arguing worst movies. Slamming something is just plain more entertaining."
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),3 contestants please... everything else is fine
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"Stop censoring the d*mn comments so heavily... It's REALLY obvious... sh*t happens... it doesn't stop existing because you delete mentions of it...





 inb4 this is deleted or shadowed..."
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Book of Henry???  Cmon now... that's a bit of a stretch
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),I like this format.
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Roxy's presence and that beautiful smile makes me melt..😩💘🔥
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),i think this formal vibe is mostly cause they are standing but besides that its great
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"I appreciate all the work that went into the new set and the new format, and i understand wanting to separate from the past, but please bring back the 3 competitors, and the less formal sitting setting, maybe a relaxed feel with some couches and a coffee table? This is just way to game show and not really that enjoyable, It's the format..not you guys, I love guys, but this is just, idk, I can't place it exactly, it just kinda...sucks...there's less fun, it's too stiff... Sorry if I'm being too harsh, again, love you guys, all of you, and thanks for the continued hard work!"
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"Finally movie fights is back! Loving the new format, but have them standing makes it feel a bit to formal. Would be better to have them sitting down. Also, having 3 combatants made the show more interesting with poeple taking sides and that kind of thing. However this is better than no movie fights at all so I'm happy"
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Im not a fan of hal as the host.. and 3 is not a crowd when it comes to movie fighting
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),bandwagon get out fans
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),I understand your decision of change the format but can we have the 3 competitors at least.
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"Joe does not like social commentary in his movies, but loved the last Star Wars movie? What?"
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),How was Death Note not considered as the worst movie of the year?!
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"Best movie: blade runner 2049

Worst movie: fifty shades darker 

Best villain: Kylo Ren"
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Please sit down again. Standing there the entire time is irritating.
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"For the love of god 3 competitors. It's added a really cool dynamic where alliances are formed and broken. Also 2 competitors allow one competitor to really dominate if the other is under prepared.

And please sit down. I couldn't possibly consider Seth rogan talking about the best movie dick with this format. It's way too formal. Sit down and relax. Maybe stay a while"
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),The new format just falls flat.  Too much dead air
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"I like the new judging format but I miss having 3 competitors it takes away stakes, everything else is great, but I hope eventually they can expand the roster and possibly have 4 competitors at a time"
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"Joe ruined the episode for me, by choosing the big sick as the best movie of 2017
The big sick vs get out
Doesn’t deserve watching"
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Finally!!!
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Get out is overrated.  Too predictable
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"Everyone asking for the old format back, please check Dan's twitter and consider listening to his points and giving them time. 

Also, I guess Max Landis aint coming back anytime soon..."
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),So glad movie fights is back!
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"This is cool, and i like the new host and judges, but pls let their be 3 fighters"
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"Too formal and not original, it's like a generic quiz bee show, I like the more casual ""people together just having fun"" style that the old format brings. so instead of doing a more formal route, go to a more casual route, let everyone sit in a couch with snacks and drinks and let the good times roll."
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),I'm fine with the two player format.  But can they be seated?  This really does look too much like a political debate.
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),You can brighten the studio a little bit more.
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),You could get bar chairs or something so we can see them above those tv screens. Just let them sit :)))
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Don't make em stand when doing drunk movie fights.
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),3 judges + Let them sit + Three fighters = fantastic new format.
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Old format please
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),The shows great and everything but the standing and the separated desks are really annoying and uncomfortable to watch.........bring the old table back and sit down it’s more comfortable and chill like I’m hanging out with u guys while I’m watching it
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"Really proud of you guys, but this was immensely disappointing. This is the first one, you have a long time in my book to get your footing. Unfortunately I found this to be one of the most boring and lame episodes so far. The old format was much more conversational, natural, and human. This format feels stiff and like a cheap game show in my opinion. I’m all for changes, and I’m with you guys forever. But this was a let down for me."
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Logan is the best movie of 2017 🔥🔥🔥
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Don't hate the changes but I kinda miss having multiple fighters/guest stars
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"It's definitely feels more like a show with this format. I don't mind it but I preferred the 3 way conversation, and more podcast like format of the old show."
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),#StayAtHomeJoe
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),There is a lot less yelling with only 2 fighters. I liked all the yelling it made it seem like a fight instead of a debate.
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Please bring back 3 fighters for the future cos this is too similar to schmoedown since it's now shorter and only has 2 fighters.. like the 3 judges tho.. are Hal and Dan not going to compete anymore tho?
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"Top 3 movies of the year:

1. Call Me by Your Name
2. Lady Bird
3. Get Out

For me, of course."
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Bright was probably one of the best movies ive seen in years
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Since everyone’s talking about the format I’d like to chime in a bit about the fighters this round — I love love LOVE Danielle and Joe! They’re such great fighters with just the right amount of seriousness and humor and good sportsmanship! Keep it up guys!!
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"The new format really does not do it for me! I loved the random banter that was happening with the previous format but now it just feels forced or just kind of plain. I don't know what it is but this new movie fights sure is lacking something. It's okay though nothing good can last forever. Happy to continue watching SJU. ScreenJunkies is great channel still and thanks for all the good work you guys put in :)

P.S. Best movie (of the ones I saw) Blade Runner 2049, worst - Flat Liners! :)"
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),I thought it was Jenna Marbels until the name popped up...
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"Everything about the new format is great. I like the extra judges, Hal is a great host, (though I'm not gonna lie, he was my favorite, and I think most underrated competitor,) and the new set is awesome. My only real complaint would be that I prefer having three fighters. Please consider bringing back the three-fighter format at least for a few special episodes if you won't do it all the time."
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),I liked Bright. I thought fantasy in the modern-day was so cool. No other movie has even broached this topic. I really liked I in fact.
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"Gotta be 3 fighters... the interaction, banter and humour rocks with 3 versus the more debate style of 2 contestants.

Polls getting input in the outcome just seems to be pandering for more subs and likes and not beneficial to the process"
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"This format is a downgrade.  In almost every respect.  It was better with 3 contestants because it allows for multiple counter-points, choices, and people to tag-team up on other's arguments.  In addition, I respect the move to use 3 judges, however there is absolutely no reason why the fan's vote should count as anything more than *maybe* a tiebreaker.  Ultimately, by using the raw fan vote, all you're really doing is picking whichever movie is more popular.  For example, how many people saw The Big Sick vs. Get Out?  The latter probably outnumbers it by more than 5 to 1, so of course the fan vote is going to sway in that direction.  It ultimately makes the fan's overall input actually *worse* than nothing because a contestant could easily just pick the most obvious popular answer to every question and automatically get the fan vote because the more obscure pick wasn't seen by as many people."
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),So happy to see a great show return
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),This will probably be drowned in all the comments that say they want the old format back. But I just wanted to say I really like the new style of movie fight and I do believe people will come around in time.
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"Honestly I don't even want to watch this with only two fighters.  It reduces the excitement and tension, and because there's less actual argument and more point-counterpoint it requires the judging to be much tighter, much more like a proper debate -- which this isn't, and will almost certainly never be, no matter what Dan says.  This show is at its best when it's ""debate lite"", and has more personalities to make it more interesting.

All this to say, BRING BACK THREE FIGHTERS."
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"TELL ME, WHERES THE JUSTICE LEAGUE HONEST TRAILER?"
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"I commented on the previous one too...  please bring back 3 contestants sitting down and more rounds. Also the sound is still a lot worse than it used to be, watching this on a tablet is almost impossible. I used to watch the whole show every week. Now I just don’t feel like watching this. Too formal setting. Almost everyone is asking for 3 people sitting, would be nice to let us know why you don’t want to keep that format."
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),No one pick blade runner 2049??????
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"Go back to the old format, with a few tweaks... like 3 judges... HATE the new set and the fact that people are standing. It seems too formal, no back and forth banter. The audio was also weird, seemed kind of low."
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Finally!!!! Miss you guys!
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Always love seeing Joe & Danielle in the same video.
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Blade Runner wall!!! OMFG - Blade Runner wall!!
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"Pleaseeeee, do it with three.
Bright isn't funny? I laughed my ass off when someone told everyone in her snapstory that Bright is her favourite movie EVER. She is 17 btw, not 12."
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"We like the old format better. 3 contestants. Sitting down. 

Love Hal as the judge"
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),All good with the new judging system and you guys are super fair (more so than you-know-who) but it's got to be at least 3 players all at the same table.
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),That breezango shirt is the best thing ever!! Fashion police for life lol #joestarr #joestarr187
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"I love the rant fight in the second question, kudos Hal to see the potential for the movie fight instead of a debate."
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),I'll echo the opinion that I like the third fighter but I enjoyed the new format
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Yo is the wall behind Joe on the set a homage to Deckard's apartment in Blade Runner??
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Love the new movie fights but I think we need 3 contestants.
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),I kno da wai
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"As previously said by others, we didn't hate the old format, the old host was the only problem..
This felt off, it felt less fun, it felt awkward. What's with the standing? They seem tense because of it.
I have never missed a single Movie Fights... NOT ONE. But I don't know that this is calling me back to watch more anymore :("
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"I understand wanting to revamp movie fights, but changing from 3 competitors to 2 takes away the feeling of friends hanging out’ talking about movies and adds a formal debate feel, which is not nearly as entertaining. I loved movie fights because of the chaotic banter and ridiculous arguments."
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"So after the return of movie fights pretty much everyone said the same thing: three fighters are better and the fighters standing behind podiums feels way too formal. Instead of taking that constructive criticism and making an improvement, they have Hal and Joe make it seem like a completely stupid complaint. It's not that we're worried about the fighters not being able to stand, it's that it looks like a political debate, and that sucks."
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Is dan still the champ or are they redoing that too?
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),I think competitors should sit. They should stand during Drunken Fights thou
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),I wonder if they will ignore all their fans and keep this new format even though everyone says they prefer the old one....
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"""I hate N words!"" hilarious"
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Hold up a gosh darn second.  Is Joe wearing a Breezango shirt?  Joe wins
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"Not liking this format, too much like a game show. I want to watch three nerds fight about movies around a table, not two contestants politely debate. If you are going to go this route, then I suggest getting some buzzers and dress the set up more like Family Feud, @Midnight, Jeopardy, Wheel of Fortune, or whatever. Either go back to the old format or do this one right, this middle ground isn't doing anyone any favors. As it is, I'm closing this one and have no plan to watch any more Movie Fights if this is what it is going to be."
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Significantly less interupting in this one.
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"I feel like this was OK, and I get you maybe want to change the format because Andy's presence might reek over that but, something feels really off whilst watching this. It was a lot nicer when the competitors were sat down and debating that way, it feels less like a presidency election, which is SO what this is, It feels way too much like you're watching Wheel of Fortune, which as good as Hal is, his host voice for this i'm not a fan of personally, i'll give it a chance but PLEASE get a third competitor, because it opens up so much more than when you just have two competitors, it gets even more competitive. Please, if you can, revert, like i've seen some people in the comments saying ""We hated the host not the old format"" to which I agree, because **** is gone, doesn't mean you can't carry on with what you had, but I don't blame any of you if this way entirely changed for comfortability sake."
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Honestly I got so bored half way through the first debate that I started scrolling through the comments and ended up pausing the video cause the repetitive comments became more interesting. I really want the old format back it just had a lot more life to it then this bland over polished nonsense
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),ehhh yikes. I dont like this new set up. Go back to 3 people and have them sit down. No one likes standing like for an hour at a podium.
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"I like Hal but as a host makes me feel rushed. I think it's just his style. Talks fast, breathes heavily to account for that talking and has some nice riffing. As a movie fighter he's just a giant run on sentence sometimes which I hear in his hosting. I'd prefer Dan to host but I can understand if he wants to continue to fact check and not be bound to hosting."
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"Things I like:
HAL
The Fact that Dan is more involved
The Fact that there are 3 judges
The New Set

Things I don't:
The fact that it feels slightly too formal (only slightly, I don't care if they sit or don't)
The Fact that there are only two fighters
The fact that there are only 3 major rounds

This version of movie fights is better than no movie fights but like..."

prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"I'm not concerned about them standing or only being 2 competitors. My issue with the new show so far is the quality doesnt seem to be there. Like their parents said ""fine you can play but down in the small room in the basement where the audio sounds weird like everyone is in separate places."" So it's been a little off putting in that respect but im hoping everyone finds their stride again and these issues people have kind of get forgotten."
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Fine with the new changes but I think 3 fighters would be best for your guys’ viewers but that might just be my opinion
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),I love movie fights.... but this...this isn't it
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"Did Joe Starr confuse Kumail Nanjiani for Jonah Ray right out the gate? I mean, they both did The Meltdown show together, but aside from The Indoor Kids podcasts being on Nerdist I'd hardly put Kumail as Hardwicks third...wtf?"
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Bring back the old 3 people competitors battle!! This one on one is slightly less entertaining. Cause the banter & disagreements are what made the show
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Will Roxy Striar be permanent on this show?
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"Feels way too formal. The essence of the show is gone. Get rid of the podiums, bring back three fighters, and let them sit. I won't be watching any more episodes that use this new format."
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Who was that sexual assaulter guy who used to be on here.
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Go back to 3 person format.
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"Halls audio/video seemed or of sync, bring back 3 contestants, and really preferred the sit-down format...but the three judges was good. Also would really like the time stamps back."
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Why didn't Joe bring up that they used hypnotism in that movie in a way that is not realistic
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"I like the new format, but this episode in particular could’ve benefitted from having a third contestant. Especially since more than half of Danielle’s answers pertained to Get Out and Joe held back from offending her. A third person really adds that intensity and additional voice in the argument"
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Bright was soooo good
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Denis Villeneuve for the Gambit movie!
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),I LOVE the 3 JUDGES format.... still prefer 3 fighters though
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"I just think that the show has lost some ""fight"" I think you can have a healthy debate and be passionate and give your points without it being personal, i understand youtube users suck, but I miss some of the strong passion in the debate. Still glad to have it back, Hal is a wonderful host"
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),If you think Bright was the worst movie of the year you didnt see enough movies lol
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Maybe a new way to differentiate the new screen junkies is to allow swearing?
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Bring back three competitor format already. Por favor!
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),I can't believe you're making them stand. I suggest you let them recline in bean bag chair. Or maybe even small hot tubs?
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"They need to practice. A lot of fun, but doesnt compare to the intensity and raw debate mastery of Dan and Spencer"
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),This movie fights format is as exciting as a presidential debate.. which coincidentally is how its set up.
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Fan artists let's get them some new movie posters. This new set doesn't feel as lively without the posters and toys.
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Sudenly screenjunkies hates Max Landis. Who before was the king of Movie Fights.
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"Miss thre fighters, the podium thing iz wierd and it didnt feel near as spicy and competitive as before then again it was only one show hopefully it will get back to being highly competitive"
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Y'all really complaining about them standing.
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Everyone posting about how they should revert to the old format should really read Dan's statement from earlier today. https://twitter.com/MurrellDan/status/951597175363915776
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"Since Max Landis wrote Bright and has been on the show before, I'd like to see him come back to fight Joe."
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"Love movie fights, and it's great to see it back. That said....even in the first question, it's obvious how the three fighter format is better. Films not addressed from Three Billboards to Shape of Water to Dunkirk to Phantom Thread to XYZ didn't get a single word in despite extremely obvious merits, and I think a third fighter would touch further in broad categories. I feel like it also adds a great bit of spontaneity, like teaming up on one argument, or having someone shoot down two people back against the wall. Couldn't care less about sitting or standing, the set doesn't really matter, and the three judges are great. I would like to see the competitors expanded a bit."
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Can you do it with the old format
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),The audience vote feels as though the show has turned into a high schoolesque popularity contest. I'm bored.
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Bright was not bad at all wtf people
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Love the new format!
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),They aren't fighting. They are just talking to each other. Kind of boring. Needs a 3rd person to interupt the conversation between 2 people.
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"The show was good, but you can make it 10x better by adding two chairs"
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Robert Pattinson was the best villain of 2017 from Good Time.
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"I dont want to stop watching these, but the 1v1 format is boring. When there were three, it was fun to see all the different opinions and ideas, and it brought the ""which two will get to the lightning round?"" that made the competition go all or nothing on their answers. The new format feels like the presidency debates but with movies. 

Love the 3 judges. But i hate this new format. Bring back the 3 people battlling it out to be on top, while chilling on a nice nerdy table. Please."
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Bladerunner/Dunkirk were my favs hands down
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"Not liking the New format, three competitors really made the fights greats. The set seems really cold, its a bit off putting."
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"bring back the old movie fights plz. This is too formal and takes the casual, relaxed nature of it away. Hal, you're a great host, but it won't feel right unless you go back to the old way."
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Why did you change the format of the show? I'm not even about to watch this. =/
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),When is tv fights coming back????
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Happy to see my favorite show back but still not the format your audience wants - just get Hal to host the show the same way!
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Keep Hal as the host but please add a third competitor and change the set up. Its like an 80s living room from a model catalogue.
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"I'm fine with this format. Congrats on coming back guys! I've missed this. I don't know how viable this is, but I'd watch a fight with two teams of two."
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Next episode please be Jeremy Jahns vs Doug Walker.
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Go back to three fighters and old format please
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),go back to the old format please
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Easily one of the best fights ever. You guys rock! And Joe - you seriously might have written some stand up material with that beautiful rant on Orc Cop Movie.
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Say it once and ill say it again. This is too formal for my liking. Will give it a chance but it will take awhile.
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),3 fighters! 3 judges! And seats!! Winning format! Not this!!
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),3 and sitting please
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Also the graphics are kind of lame. not nearly as dynamic as before. seems like a half effort all around. shame really I was excited to have movie fights back . this legit bored me.
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Please let the Fighters sit down.
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"1 on 1???? that's not fun guys. I prefer the 3 competitors method. this is too game show setup.  Prefered the podcast style. 
But for sure 3 people makes for more interesting conversations. pretty much a Screen Junkies Universal consensus."

prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),No time stamps in the description?
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"Movie fights are back! I loved it. It needs the 3 fighter, chairs and the old mics Hal  doesn't sound very good in the current set up."
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"Solid start for Hal, but he seemed to hold their hands a lot during the arguments. Id rather see less of him guiding the arguments and more pressure on the contestants to think of good arguments."
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),I love Danielle and Joe together
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"Can we try the old format, just once, just to see how it feels...maybe?"
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Bright is my 3rd best movie of the year
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"While I think Joe won the debate... picking Bright is dumb.   Dannielle could have hit him war harder. Emoji movie, Justice League, Transformers, Fifty Shades."
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"Haven’t watched the whole thing yet only at the introduction still...I just want to say I’ve always been with screenjunkies. I know it’s very hard to continue on after all that’s happened, but I think the channel has powered through and down a wonderful job to separate from the situation and come out anew. That being said. We as fans are here with you SC, we are ready to move on and I would like to feel like Hal and everyone else has moved past it and are ready to get back to fully enjoying this wonderful community and not trying to save face or put on a brave one. Also seeing only two participants, idk how that will work out. And while I’m okay with a set change, I will say I can already tell I will really really really extremely miss the set up that allowed to feel like a GROUP of movie lover angry opinionated friends going at it. I want that over this game show feel. I hope you read ScreenJunkies. I love you, we all do"
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),3 contestants and chairs makes it a movie hangout not some overblown GSN game show
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Three fighters works best. I perfer it because it shows off personalities more and leads to more movie recommendations
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),3 fighters please

prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),I love this format. It is a true debate format. This is much better than screaming over each other. The points being made can be heard. Danielle hitting with Get Out is great. This was the best film in February.
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Please balance audio for next time.

prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"I do enjoy the three judge aspect of this new iteration, but please bring back the ""Three-Way Dance of Death-ish-like-esque"" contestant format. Having the third contestant present brought more to the table in terms of responses, counterarguments, and schnazziness (doubt that is a real word, but let's just run with it anyway). As for the comic book reference, it was the Fatal Attractions story arc regarding Magneto ripping Wolverine's adamantium skeleton."
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),That was just fun and great time :)
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),I’m so happy it’s back. I actually am fine with the two people. I think people will get used to it too. I feel like the quality is off and idk why!
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"I understand trying to change things up to differentiate from the days of 'he who shall not be named' but this isn't ""Movie Fights."" This is clearly ""Movie Debates"" and is about as fun as such, a political debate. Two people standing behind podiums with a moderator. Please think about incorporating some of what made it fun before. As I have seen others say, we had little problems with the original format, just ""him"" and his tendency to yell and purposefully incite hatred between fighters. At this rate, I'm concerned that we will never see another drunk fight. Ken Napzok deserves to defend that belt to the death!"
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Kind of hope they go back to the three person format.

prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"kinda wish there was another fighter just because it gives more options than just 2 choices. logan is still my best movie of 2017. i agree that getout is a reimagining of steford wives...that's what was going in my mind and even jordan was giving tons of examples of what get out structure is based off. and i dunno, i actually called the brain transfer thing but i think its cause i watch too many horror so i knew what was gonna happen 1/3 into the movie lol(i pride myself on that).   and baby driver because that movie really did something now one has done with music and action..plus that editting. wow."

prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"I like having three fighters more. Here's why; I liked how you would always have two regulars who I knew/ or I was looking forward to seeing debate a certain question. The third space was then allotted to a newbie, who was trialled with two regulars. This way if there was one crappy debater the other two would always still perform.Now, if one contestant doesn't show up with their game face on or are having a poor day it will be super noticeable."

prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"1) Bring back 3 fighters.
2) Let them sit."
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),This is kinda boring with just 2 contestants... Bring in the 3rd!!! When things goes off the rails is when Movie Fights becomes amazing!!

No, Joe... Nooooooo"

prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),BRING BACK 3 COMPETITORS.
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),I know you needed a fresh start for movie fights but I don't feel this format is quite it yet. Hope you can make some tweaks here and there to get to the full potential.
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"I dont hate the new format, but i think the old format is slightly better. Still enjoyed this ep tho"
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Joe Rogan is the key to everything!  😃😆🤔
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"One on one? Yawn. It's a joust, not a fight. We need the madness. Hard pass on this."
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"Whilst i liked the old format with 3 fighters, i do kind of prefer just the 2. In the old format there was multiple times it just descended into a shouting match and the loudest/strongest voice was the one that got heard and some of the fights got into less about the debate and more about who could just control the room. It didn't happen all the time but there was certainly situations where there was just to many voices, this feels more structured and organised and easier to give both arguments equal time, and no one can just get 2v1 and shut out the conversation

I also think with hal's hosting style and posing them the questions rather than just leaving it to them to fight on the movie alone adds an extra element to the debate and probably wouldn't work as well with 3 ""fighters""

And finally i think with 2 fighters you have a better chance of not falling into what was my biggest problem with the old format (and why i stopped watching weekly), repetitiveness. I know its hard to get people to be willing to give up their time for this (especially if its live and has to be at set times very week) but the old movie fights ended up feeling like the same 10 fighters rotating, with only 2 each week i think even if you have a similar issue with the numbers of guests you can get it will be less noticeable as you wont be matching opponents as often"
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Overall I'm like the changes. Just needs a little more spice without losing the friendliness.
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"I think the 3 fighter format is definitely better and as trivial as you probably think it sounds, having the contestants sit down around a desk is definitely better imo. It just feels more natural and fun."
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Not enough talk about Star Wars: The Last Straw
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"Damn, I was really hoping that one of the reasons Roxy was on the show today was because they were going to announce the return of TV fights. :("
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"Great initiative (again) :) 

Two suggestions:

Have them sit down (similar to how it was earlier... this feels too formal)
Have three contestors!"
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Does anyone else’s start chipmunking halfway through joes first argument?
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),3 fighters plz
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"""what/who is the best/worst...?"" questions actually are much better 3 contestants I feel. I really disliked the 2 choices for ""best"" and while the 2 choices for worst were both bad I think there were a few movies that were worse. I don't even recognize the 2 choices for ""best"" villains as valid. Having a third contestant gives a much better chance of getting it right in my mind even if they don't win at least I would get to hear someone I agreed with. Easy fix for best/worst is to give choices, maybe 5 picked by the fans or judges?"
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"Like others, I miss the older format, especially with 3 fighters.  This feels too ""attempting to look professional"" and I preferred the more casual atmosphere of the older ones, like 3 friends sitting on a couch debating dumb stuff like we all get into with our friends.  Keep the multiple judges, the set looks nice, but I wish it'd feel less like a cheap game and and more like a fun casual sort of thing."
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Danielle and Joe = #friendshipgoals        I would watch a weekly show with them just doing movie-related stuff
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"Please do an honest trailer for ""The 100"""
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"It is kind of boring with just 2 people, regardless of who the contenders are."
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),I really like hal as the new host. His judgement is actually rather sound
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),This is a fun episode of movie conversation. Please bring back MOVIE FIGHTS.
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),still hate the new movie fights format....but I GUESS i'll still watch
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Bring back the 3 ppl format!!! We loved the chaos!! BOOOOO!!!
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),I’m sure the set cost a lot to update but I’m not sure this is going to do it. I’ll give it a few more shows but if they don’t read the comments soon they are gonna lose a lot of loyal movie fight watchers.
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"I really like that SJ are changing up the format, I like the 3 judges, but I'd prefer them to be sitting down way less formal, more fun. And 3 fighters, I want to see Dan Murrell back with the championship belt."
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),much prefer the  triple threat format
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),love everything new but don't feel as compelled to watch with only 2 competitors.  PLEASE keep the new look while bringing back the 3 fighter format.
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"I'm sorry but The Book of Henry was insanely original and different, and I appreciate it so much for that..."

prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"love that MF is back, don't like the format very much it feels a lot like your typical game show and not your nerdy movie lovers radio show that happens to be youtubed...something like that, keep up the good work! <3"
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),I like the old way they used to do moviefights
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Best movie of the year: Blade Runner 2049. No discussion needed
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"Best movie: Blade Runner 2049
Worst movie: Baywatch
Best villain: Kylo Ren

Also, I like the new format!"
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"1 Bladerunner 2049 or Coco
2 The Mummy or Baywatch
3 The Vulture or Hela are the best villains"
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),I do like this format better. It feels cleaner and there less arguing over each other. My only problem is that I find the set kind of boring.
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"could do with another competitor, but Hal's killing it as a host/moderator"
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),By the way bright is getting a sequel so..... Were is Henry 2?
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Ffs there were other movies than get out that year. 🙄
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Please bring back 3 fighters
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"Hey SJ, would you mind putting the time stamps in the description? I don't really have 1 hour to watch this, but am still interested in the picks and first presentation of arguments. Thank you!"
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Really miss the third competitor!! Loved today's fighter!! #daniellerules
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"1. I kind of like the new format. It kind of reminds me of formal debates.
2. How long before Andreyko gets to guest host?
3. How is Bright in the running for Worst of the year? I mean, I'd give it a C- at worst."
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Hal is the perfect host for this new format.
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"I'm so glad that Movie Fights is back, but I have to agree that the 3 fighter format is better. It might not seem like much, but a 3rd fighter means a 3rd option which makes the fights more interesting."
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"I really like having movie fights back, and everyone was great today. One thing I'm sure everyone noticed afterward is that the sound is a little flat and picking up too much echo from the room, so I hope that's not too hard to fix."
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Liked the old format better.
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"I loved the idea of three judges, but I miss the insanity of three contestants. I was also much more of the casual sitting down format. Movie fights was always a casual ""for fun"" thing and this game show style makes it look more... ""Serious"" I guess is the best word I can think of right now? Also, bring back the 5 rounds :("
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Bright as the worst movie of the year? That's gonna have to be a dislike for me dawg.
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Old format please
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),If this is the permanent format I’m unsubbing
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"I strongly prefer the old format, minus the sexual predator."

prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Bright was crap for sure.
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),best movie for me is either Mother! or Brawl in Cell Block 99.  The two they named were solid but wouldn't make my top 5.
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Bright so not the worst Joe. Bring back the chairs 👍
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"Hey man, don't riff Max man, he's solid."
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Please put the times of the questions in the description
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),25 minutes it too damn long for a single question.  Set a 10 minute limit on a debate please.
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"I look forward to every movie fights. Always will

But please listen to the fans here. Bring back 3 bring back sitting."
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),When joe said that Dunkirk was the best movie of 2017 I legit flipped him off on my screen. Even tho it really wasn’t his pick.
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"Why are they dissing Max Landis so much? I thought he was a ""screen junkies regular""."
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"I'm so thankful for Hal, he's great at hosting and very entertaining to watch. I love that there are three judges now but I'm still getting used to the two fighters format and the standing. So far I prefer the old format but I'm willing to give it a chance. One thing I did notice is that this two fighter format exposes weaker arguments and weaker fighters before when there were three fighters it was less noticeable now rounds can be much more lopsided if someone doesn't bring their A game. I'm rooting for you guys and hope you guys find your groove and continue to improve upon the format."
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"As a fan whose been watching movie fights for a long time and has seen the development of the show, I have very mixed feelings about the new format. Like most comments, I agree that three fighters created a better fight environment rather than just two people having a debate. The feel of the new show seems artificial. The standing up may be the reason it feels odd, and if they were all sitting down maybe it would be different. Higher production value is loved but not at the cost of the fun, more natural fights. Having a new judge/host is great (thank you hal!) and the three judges i hope will get rid of the false accusations of favoritism’s from the judges. Nothing will stop me from watching movie fights, but still it has a whole different vibe, and I don’t know if I like it as much. Yep :))"
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Definitely wish it was back to three competitors
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"Love the new format! It's way more fun. The old version started feeling too serious and dark and heavy, I stopped watching. 

This new style feels more like an evening game show a la Jeopardy or Wheel of Fortune. Way lighter, takes itself just as seriously as it needs, but never goes too far to where it could cause death threats (as I know the lost way did.) I love the new production value here! Congrats on a new more fun, still exciting, movie fights :D"
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),28:25 it was so dark i couldn't even see Will Smith
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),I think the problem is with two person fight is whith broard questions like movie of the year. There are so many posible answeres and many people go with the same 1 or two that with three people you get a little more instreting picks then just two .
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"Guys, will you guys please do time stamps for each topics again? 😊"
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),It doesn't make a damn difference whether they are sitting or standing. Also give 2 contestants a chance
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),I like the new design...Very Jeopardy...Lets get 3 contestants back though please
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"Best is Logan, period"
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),I like the comment about rom-coms being watched on planes because I first watched the big sick on a plane.
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Im good with all the changes exept the two people insread of three. Please go back to three. Besides this I still love the show
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),I like the format but hate the lectern thing. Bring back the chairs and table... Even if it's completely redesigned and sterilised of that disgusting troll.
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),I miss having 3 contestants. I hope that comes back. Can talk about 3 different best movies etc. so many options out there.
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),How are we going to have Drunk Fights of they're standing? SIT THOSE FIGHTERS DOWN!
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),This new setup just doesn't feel right
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"You guys should really learn how to pronounce Villeneuve. So far, the only youtuber I heard pronounce his name right is Chris Stuckmann in his Blade Runner 2049 review. Other than that great movie fight! :)"
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"I miss the 3-Fighters format and having them sitting down. This feels too formal and I really enjoyed the more casual feel of the old format. I do like the 3 Judges part though, that's a really nice way to keep things more impartial and it makes the judging part more interesting."
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),I'd watch these if they weren't so friggin long.
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"Best movie of 2017: Get Out
Worst Movie of 2017: The Emoji Movie
Best Villain of 2017: Not a lot of great villains this year but if I had to choose I guess it would have to be Kylo Ren or maybe The Vulture. I agree with Danielle’s choice but you could argue that others in that family are a lot worse."
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"Three fighters please. Other than that, it's great"
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"Don't like this format. Need three fighters, old format was perfect"
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"I love that movie fights is back, but please change the forum back to how it was. It sounds like your in a bathroom, and - besides - it just feels weird. Still, I love this game and I love you guys~"

prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Chairs guys seriously 😂
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"That first round was almost 18 minutes long. That’s a really long time, especially when there’s only 2 fighters. 
Really wish they’d listen to the fans and bring the old format back."
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),3 FIGHTERS!!!!!!!!
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),3 fighters like EVERYONE is saying instead of two and yes the standing up feels very unnatural and too political for a laid back friendly fight so to speak - at least get stools like when you do the screen junkies show
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Why not just keep the old format with a new judge? I really miss the 3 fighter structure!
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),thank you! i can finally watch movie fights again <3
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),I would rather add one more fighter then have 3 judges
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"I like 3 fighters, more diversity, and more fun banter to listen to! Happy Movie Fights is back tho!"
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Is there a reason this video doesn't have a download button?
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),So glad movie fights is back. 🙌🏻
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Also. I'll fight anyone. Is the belt still real? I want it. Bring it Dan. Or Spencer.
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"How was bright bad? It was a fine movie. There were far worse movies. Transformers last knight, emoji movie, Baywatch, alien covenant, justice league. Those were bad movies."
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Yayyy it's back!
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),You need 3 fighters that variance is needed. Don't mind the 2 judges and a tiebreaker but at most the audience should be the tiebreaker if included at all.
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),TIL standing up vs sitting is a big deal... for some reason. Who cares.
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Blade Runner 2049 is one of best film of year and is going be classic
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Calm down everyone. Let them work this out. Change takes time.
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Great improvements but please stick with three contestants..also let them sit
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"I'm glad you guys are trying things out, but I like the three players sitting down format with the new judging system. This isn't coming from someone afraid of change..I think it would just work better this way"
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Worst movie of the 2017 was Death Note...
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"Change is good, but it feels a bit more sanitized with two fighters and the standing seems super uncomfortable. Have more than two combatants and for the love of god, let them sit down. Love the three judges, though."
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"Three fighters, please... And let them sit... 
This format isn't ideal... 

I get the need to separate oneself from a horrible situation, but there is no need to destroy everything, especially if it is still viable..."
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Logan was the best movie of 2017
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"Obligatory judgement about changes of show either positive or negative, with undertone of fear of change.  Snarky, tongue-in-cheek comment about that thing we're not mentioning.  Shout-out to mom.  Calling random Screen Junkie a ""movie-snob.""  Poster below me is wrong about their particular opinion and as such will receive a funny-insult."
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Last JEDI hands down worst movie since The Room.
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"Everything is awesome, but please bring back the three fighter format with sitting. The fights are politer which isn't a bad thing, but feels more like a casual debate. I really love the new judging system! The old judging format was horribly biased and Hal is great and great moderator. You guys are on to making something great, just try to make it three fighters if possible"
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Best movie of 2017? Baby Driver.

prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"Got rid of scumlord. <3
Reformatted Movie Fights </3
It just doesnt feel as chill? It feels kinda corporate if you know what I mean?  Im sorry i cant quantify it but I hope things change for the good."
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),I love the 3 judge thing but I liked it more with 3 fighters and sitting
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"No, Dunkirk was the best movie of 2017






IMO"
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),I'm okay with three judges but I would like the old format on sitting down back
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),I loved 2 fighters!! And the new format. Give the audience more time to get used to things before going back to 3(if you ever do).
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"Go back to 3 fighters please, this format isn't good."
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"Bright was real dookie, but your guy made really odd critiques"
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),3 fighters is a must. Format is fine but come on get these guys some seats.
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"I love this, this was good and it felt like the old movie fights. My one critique, as many have said, is that I wish there were three fighters again. That one extra person just makes it all the more interesting statistically. Like, we know either Joe or Danielle is going to win..it's not that compelling, but adding that singular person makes it feel like anyone's game and then the final round is that much more interesting. Also, I like the additional judges but I feel like viewers shouldn't be one. They, largely, will pick what they most enjoy as we've seen in the past instead of basing it off the arguments."
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),finally! missed movie fights. prefer it with 3 competitors though.
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"Is there anyway you will still do some fights in the old format? I'm not gonna lie, I don't like this one very much."
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),The last Jedi was amazing
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Bring back the old movie fights format.
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),I've missed movie fights soo much

wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,The Spiderman costume is AWFUL. It looks SO FAKE and CGI. Amazing Spiderman 2's costume NAILED IT.
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,"I went to see Batman v Superman today and the trailer in question trailer was shown before it. After it was over, while I snickered to the fact they  had just showed a Marvel trailer before a DC movie, I heard two school boys speak to each other in the row under me. I heard the first one say what translates to: ""so they got Spidey? Awesome."" . The other answered: ""Yeah, the cherry on the top of the whipped cream"". The first kid replied (I'll break down the translation, it was a pun). I burst laughing and literally had to stuff my scarf into my mouth, because it was a good and a bit dirty pun. The boy said: _""kirsikkana kermaperseen päällä""_. While _kirsikka_ is the cherry, and _päällä_ means above or on top of, the word for whipped cream is _kermavaahto_, literally ""cream foam"". _Kermaperse_ means a person who is snobbish and indifferent towards the poor, but the literal meaning is ""cream booty"".

I don't even know why I wrote this down... Forgive me (sorry not really sorry)..."

wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,Do The Divergent Series: Allegiant
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,would have been better if Spidey have snatched C.A. Shield in mid flight
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,rock and a hard place... then comes Spiderman. .. now the real heart comes back .. the real man.. the average person.. and Capt. come full circle ... from boring guy to the man.. the glue.. the one who will always bring them all together
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,"How pathetic marvel! You are going to try to have us believe that Koslo, which could have resulted in the destruction of the world if not for the Avengers is pointed to as  fault of the Avengers?  What would have happen to New York, Washington or Koslo if the Avengers had not intervened?  why don't you writers give us readers some credit for not being stupid?  So you telling us that the Avengers even though they saved the world 3 times that doesn't mean ""nothing?"" You are saying that the destruction is to blamed on the Avengers?  What would have happen w/out the Avengers?  Marvel this is obvious that you are stealing from DC w/out any ground to justify the civil war (no reasonable reason)"
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,Marvel fan boys
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,YOU GUYS MUST REMEMBER THAT HIS EYES WERE FIRST DONE IN XMEN THE ANIMATED SERIES WITH WOLVERINE AND OTHERS 1994
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,its far-fetched...but do you think that Spiderman will be in line with the continuity of the Disney XD channel  Ultimate Spiderman  The MCU movies are hinted at in some episodes and younger viewers would recognise it as being that spiderman as well.
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,Do y'all think Spidey will reveal his identity to the public like he did in the comic book?
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,"Everyone is freaking out because Spiderman was in the trailer...

wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,more honest action plz
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,"I'm kind of disappointed they showed Spider-Man in the trailer. I really wanted it to be a in-movie reveal, not a trailer reveal. Imagine it like a Luke Skywalker type of thing. We know he's in the movie, but when?? People would be on the edge of their seats waiting for Spider-Man in the movie, but now we know when he is coming. It would be so much more epic"
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,no I think Underoos might be easy voice command for the iron spider armor much like the house party was the voice command on an Iron Man 3 so the way that I would set it up would be here that would be a great pose when he jumps down also the cop car is the spider armor comes in

wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,"Marvel Studios revealed Spidey after all of the speculation that his suit would appear in all kinds of strange ways... I think this trailer was the smartest thing to drop on the fans, especially when they show us the web-slinger in the classic uniform, which is what we ALL wanted to see. Now everyone has a confirmation that they want to see Spidey along with the Avengers. There is no more doubt, now we all want to see the film."
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,Host needs to let the people speakkk
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,THEY SHOULD HAVE KEPT ANDREW GARFIELD

wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,I just want to see how it affects AoS.
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,"Not too happy about the costume, but its all good."
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,"4:49 That ""Sp"" tho ..."
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,"yeah not gonna lie, antman on the arrow was my favourite part of the trailer too. I love it when the superhero films remember that they've got more than a little inherent silliness simply by featuring superheroes and just roll with it. grit without fun is just a tedious slog, just as fun without grit is meaningless fluff"
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,Matt Key looks like an old Kylo Ren
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,Um it's good!
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,I do think that the prison is the raft.
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,"The head is definetly CGI, the rest of the suit is physical. It can be noticed with how the Red affects the camera"
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,Not the biggest fan of the suit but I understand that they needed to distinguish it from the earlier ones.
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,HEY! GO NAVARRO! MAKE OUR SURNAME PROUD HOMIE!
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,I wanna see the movie already😣

wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,"I'm really confused about everyone's hard on for Spider-Man being a teen. He's been an adult for about 50 years now in the comics, why does everyone think he needs to be teenaged? Literally all of his best moments and storylines come from adult Spidey. Besides the Ultimate version, who's perpetually teenaged and (SPOILERS) dead, which is just as awesome."
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,OMG!!!!
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,"I LOVE the new spider-man costume. I was a little unsure at first, but after looking at it closely, i fell in love with it!"
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,They came all over the place at 5:10 to 5:25 XD

wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,honest trailer for SUPERNATURAL
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,I really enjoyed this episode of Screen Junkies Show ! Making me ten times more excited than I already am for this movie!
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,"Great trailer, but... I disagree on Spider Man in the trailer. IMHO, that's showing too much. We all knew there is spider man in the plot, but I liked the expectation of knowing how he would have been. 
I mean, not even close to the Batman vs Superman disastrous trailer (the one before the last), but still it feels like studios are so busy that trailers are put together by interns :-("
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,Finally! I thought Marc Andreyko was gonna be in this video.
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,Where's the link to the original trailer? I don't care about your opinions.

wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,Matt Key looks like old Adam Driver.
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,"I hope Captain America gets the chance to rebut Ross' video montage before that scene is over. ""Yeah, the aliens in New York.  That was caused when we played with the tesseract, right?  Oh, except when I say 'we,' I mean 'you,' because that was the government's fault. ""And Washington D.C., that was my fault how?  Did I build those killer helicarriers?  Oh no, wait, that was the government again.  Wait, Tony, I think you were helping them. ""Speaking of Tony, who build the giant evil robot that destroyed Sokovia?  Oh, I remember, that was you. ""Tell me again, why am I here?  You only seem to call me when you're destroying the world."""
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,what's weird is I have a friend named Hector Navarro
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,"Spider Man: ""Look at me."" Captain America just stares, ""I'm the captain now."""
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,I'm freakin hyped

wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,Very excited to see the film.
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,during the kids choice awards showed another trailer that had a few new scenes in it where they showcased agent13 fighting with Bucky OMG😝😋🙌
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,Matt looks like an older Adam Driver
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,I'm pretty sure that that blast that takes out Rhodes looks alot like Ms Marvels energy blasts from the comics
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,"This discussion was a little premature, because there was no discussion of the biggest *SPOILER* displayed in the trailer! Look closely at the trailer at around the 2:40 mark, on the ground behind Cap... Mind Blown!!"
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,Why does iron man say underoos
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,i Want kung fu panda trilogy Honest Trailer
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,#TeamStark #TeamBlackPanther #TeamTChalla
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,"I like what he said, that this shows that the MCU is changing its tonality across the universe now.  Which was my biggest complaint of the Whedon era MCU, it was way to white bread and disneyfied.  So I'm glad the Russo Bros are doing their thing."
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,Spiderman looks like a freaking cheap budget cartoon character wtf with colors and those eyes lmao
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,"DC's way of revealing new heroes: Wonder Woman looking as badass as possible after saving Batman and Superman.
Marvel's way of revealing new heroes: Spiderman say the least exciting thing possible in puppy voice after stealing shield from Captain America outside a real fight."
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,CG Spidey looks terrible! Really hope the tighten that up and make him look more realistic for the final cut.
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,"It is unbelievable how this movie and BvS are exactly the same movie, and how this trailer  is exactly like the second BvS trailer, which everybody hated, however, everybody is wetting themselves over  this one, just because is Marvel´s.   SHAME.   The Dirty Fanboys War goes on.... Well done, Marvel Biatches!"
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,The airport was visible in the background when Rhodes was on the ground so that probably isn't  a second trigger. just btw
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,"I like how everyone is going against each other. Cap is fighting tony, winter solider is fighting black panther, black window is fighting Hawkeye, scarlet witch is fighting vision and war machine is fighting falcon. Everyone is going against each other except ant man, he's just chilling XD"
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,Strictly speaking... all those tragedies listed could have been prevented if Tony Stark had just stayed a bored playboy.  New York... bad guys used his arch reactor technology.  Washington... the helicarirers used Tony's upgrades after what happened to the original one after Avengers.  And Ultron..... Maybe Tony should be barred from tinkering with technology - like how convicted hackers are barred from using computers.
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,"I love the new spiderman suit, but why did they have to cast a 12 year old boy?"
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,The Spidey reveal stole the thunder from the rest of the characters. It would have been different if Spider-man had always been in the MCU all along. No one is talking about Black Panther or Vision or any one else. Yes the Ant-Man arrow shot is cool but Tony's tech will probably give him a defense electro shock and take him out. All in all this is Spider-man's trailer.
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,"Wow....that is the worst Spiderman costume I've ever seen. So much for ""Give it back to Marvel"""
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,Forgive my ignorance but is Prison 42 like Azkaban?

wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,"whats crazy is nobody i knew ever liked Spider-Man and now they love him. i dont get it, its just he was in the trailer"
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,It would make sense if Spider-Man was there to stop the fight.
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,Golitah may not be in the movie but if Ant-Man is growing...
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,As mush as I like the new suit I think that's just his original design an will get a better one later on
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,"Its funny how Iron man in the trailer is so like on board with the government/Shield stuff, considering almost all the disasters in the MCU are his or SHIELD's Fault fault. In new york its his power supply than lets loki open the portal, in DC its SHIELD thats at fault for not noticing HYDRA in its own ranks and nearly killing 1000's of innocent people, and ultron is 100% Tony's fault cause of his ego. If they just locked Tony Stark up half the disasters wouldn't happen. Without Captian America just going rogue and doing whats right the world woulda been over long ago"
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,Is this movie gonna be 4 hours long? It better be 😍
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,I wish i knew nerds like you irl. I literally have no one that I can have conversations about the MCU with.  People are freaking out about spiderman tho.
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,"did anyone else notice that 74+23+177=274 which could be related to a specific marvel comic book. I'm not a huge Marvel Comicbook Nerd (I strive to be one day) but I'm pretty sure that might have something to do with something. also since when I looked up ""marvel 274"" all the comics listed had to do with either Cap or Zemo. Anyone have any theories????"
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,I think the Spiderman reveal was a brilliant move to get people to be more exited for the movie. Especially to get to those who are Spiderman fans but not as much Avengers and such.
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,WTF? I saw spidey in the trailer.
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,i liked atman on the arrows
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,I screamed like a little girl when I saw the trailer
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,"Even though he's not in the MCU, Deadpool needs to make an appearence and say,""woah, woah whats with the commotion!? What is the point of this. You two need to stop killing each other because you still have two more years on your contract. the audience wants to see another Avengers movie. Who knows maybe Thanos can get out of his ass and give you guys another box offices smash"""

wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,"Oh boy here we go again, screen junkies sucking each others dicks while worshipping another Marvel movie. Is there óne thing you guys can be critical about in MCU?"

wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,"i can already tell I will be screaming at the screen about all the things the heroes get blamed for that was not their fault, like the invasion, like if they were not there the governments answer was to nuke NYC, like Ultron was 100% Iron Mans fault. I can already tell I am really going to be into this movie. and Spiderman!!!!! Cant wait.."
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,"I love Hector, but geez, dude, let the others get a word in from time to time."
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,"Don't care what other ppl think, but his costume looks dumb af. It's not a cartoon anymore, even if they are paying tribute to the classic Spiderman with that suit. It looks dumb. But, of course, that's just my opinion"
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,"when Cap uppercuts Stark with his shield towrads the end, pause it and you see WS laying behind Cap with his metal arm torn off and looking deadish"
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,Just hope the Spidey suit isn't CGI the whole time.
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,Thought the reveal was well done and was a great appetizer to the 7 course meal that will be served in Captain America: Civil War.  Awesome panel.

wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,"I just hope the ending of the movie is better than the comic ending, where Cap just gives up because he looks around and sees some rubble.

wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,"Thought the reveal was great.  Everybody knew he was going to be showing up in this movie, anyway. (Which probably has nothing to do with a tweet I sent to 20th Century Fox, Sony Pictures, Marvel and Stan Lee a few years ago).

The reveal didn't spoil anything.  I wonder what angle they're going to take on his standalone MCU movie?"
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,I swear Spider-Man will be the only reason I watch civil war.
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,Let's make a conversation. Marvel > DC

wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,"I thought he shouted ""On the roof"""
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,"suit looks thin and flat. maybe if they made the web lines on the suit more prominent it would be better, it looks fine but this is just my opinion."
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,I'm on Cap's side. But most likely Cap will lose as he is surrounded by Iron man's team at the end of the trailer when they all look beat up.
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,Pretty sure Rhodes is alive because he's there when Tony calls for Spiderman and tony looks the same then as when he is holding Rhody earlier in the trailer
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,I think they did the right thing revealing Spider-Man cause it's only 2 months away
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,is not the 42 is obviously the raft! because is under-water

wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,"You know what, forget Andrew Garfield now, this new Spiderman looks frickin cool!! I hope they just do it where hes already been arnd in this universe, so alluding to Garfield's previous Amazing Spiderman movies, and just go from there. NO origin behind Spiderman now, its been done to death, its getting tedious now."

wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,"Why does Spiderman look like a shiny plastic toy from the first Toy Story movie?? he looks completely cgi but only him, why??"
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,The only thing I don't want to happen is crossbones killing cap. Chris Evans is like the ideal guy to play cap and I don't want to see him go.

wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,Soo much yapping. I been looking over the years I've seen from the pyscholodylic spidey to the time of Carnage and Venom until some know and then but this kid give me a break. Spider Man should evolve to a man. But they stick to him on teenage to college. Tobey McQuire should been tapped to be the mature spider man.
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,Did anyone see that guy pass by the screen??? lol xD
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,Nobody notice QuickSilver in THE trailer i thinks hè coming back
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,"im still hoping but wouldn't surprised if they introduce the red hulk.because after all the heroes kiss and make up you're talking 11-12 heroes if warmachine recovers possibly 13 if that was quicksilver sitting that tube.but unless baron zemo has a super army to fight all those good guys he would need some extra muscle,hence general ross aka red hulk...wishful thinking"

wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,"Wow, talk about reading to much into something.  It was 2:30 minute trailer.  lol good video guys."
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,I think spidey's eyes are digital. Like some tech is integrated into the suit. Maybe like a magnifying/focus thing because when the white of the eyes change shape there is still rims of different eye sizes on the black border. Either that or it's just the result of the effects not being done yet. What does everyone else think of my theory?
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,Been rewatching the civil war trailer and I think the suit IS real. At first it looked very CGI but rewatching it actually looks real - except his eyes obviously. And I watched the trailer yesterday without knowledge of all of the comments on social media about the Spiderman suit.
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,Team cap who side are you on
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,"Disagree on the voice.  :p  In the mask, he got mistaken for older, so his voice shouldn't be a give away to it."

wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,What's even more entertaining than the film is four adult men geeking out like school girls over the awesomeness of these fictitious characters becoming entities on the big screen.

wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,"Spiderman's suit is garbage. The eyes are fucked up, the black outlining on his arms and legs look out of place and the animation is terrible. There is good CGI then there's this failure."
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,I'm at the point where I just don't care about these movies anymore.
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,"I wish you guys had put a spoiler-warning on this. Hector didn't stick with what was in the trailer and maybe gave something away at the end. (I'm trying to be vague. Maybe he was speculating, but it sounded like he knew something.)"
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,do Mean girls please!!!!!
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,DC does serious and works in jokes to break up the seriousness. Marvel is more jovial and it breaks up that with great bits of seriousness. The statement of he is my friend part is so moving.
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,When they talk about antman: Antheyyeahthehaekeye
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,Pretty sure it was Scarlet Witch who was tearing up.
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,"I think the fight between cap and tony will be very personal.  It has been building ever since avengers and I think that tony has been looking forward to kicking steves ass, since he is jealous of him, and the reveal of spidey was epic I really like the suit and age of the actor being younger"
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,I CAN'T WAIT!!!!

wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,I actually laughed when i saw this costume...inono why..looks like the 70s spiderman tv show....but i hope we get tosee the Iron spiderman costume at the end of the movie becuz Tony Stark/Ironman...duh..

wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,Spider-Man sounded like a child. Not a good sign.
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,"I don't think Spider-Man looks bad, he looks like what Ultimate Spider-Man is supposed to look like."
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,I can do this all day is the best line in the movie. I can't believe that there is a better line in this film
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,The icing on the cake with this reunion of Spiderman back home with Marvel is have brief flashback with Peter and unle Ben but have uncle Ben played by Spidy's creator Stan Lee. You cannot tell me that would not be cool and may Stan Lee could get emotional on set with one of his greatest works.
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,I'll second Hector's final thought oooohhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!

wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,maybe agent/director colson shoots war machine down cause he's kinda dedicated to cap is there a possibility colson makes it in the movie? he's not been in a film since he died :(  Just a new aspect
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,anyone who hates spiderman new costume needs to shut up and read the costume. this is by far the best costume
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,"I think that ""Underoos"" is -- at the very least -- a nod to Stan Lee's opening words in the AMAZING FANTASY #15 story: ""Like costume heroes? Confidentially, we in the comic mag business refer to them as ‘long underwear characters’! And, as you know, they’re a dime a dozen! But, we think you may find our SPIDERMAN just a bit . . . different!”"

wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,I think this Spider-Man suit you see is a suit that Tony or S.H.I.E.L.D makes for him after he joins Tony side. I bet he starts out in a costume that looks like a 15 year old poor kid made it.
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,Notice there are no web pieces stuck to Capt's shield after it was webbed by Spidey? I also hope this Spidey is just pre-production. It looks like a cheaper CGI cartoon version of Deadpool's costume.

wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,"Honestly, I am a bit worried about how they are going to handle using all the characters we already know (and love) and introducing all the new ones. Putting too many villains has proven to be a bad idea in the past (Spiderman 3 for instance) if not treated carefully, so it could turn out to be all the same with heroes, and there's the possibility of them not receiving all the justice they should.
This said, I am so excited about this movie I can't even stand myself.
Great show, as always!!"

wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,Not hyped for this movie... AT ALL.
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,Im 110% sure that the spidey scene wasn't cgi (except for the eyes) its just we aren't used to his suit being so smooth because all the others ones were textured with raised webbing so thats why people think it is bad cgi.
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,Is that Chiwetel Ejiofor (Baron Mordo from Doktor Strange) at 0:40 in The Trailer?

They've saved Giant Man and Zemo so unlike BvS they haven't gone ahead and revealed everything!I am a bit worried that Baron Zemo is just going to be an afterthought though given how he's gotten no love in the trailers, it's all been about Cap vs Iron Man"
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,Why is there no Hulk or Thor in this movie?
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,Matthew looks like Kylo Ren.
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,CGI spidergirl!!!
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,Too much Spidey. Maybe a back shot or only a web shot. Not a full frontal. I think the success of Deadpool and the hype of BvS had Marvel nervous.
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,"If Spidey in the trailer is a CGI, it actually doesn't look too good. I agree with how they reveal Spidey too, just the right amount of time. About the new costume design, at first I was still judging it real hard, but after another look....meh, whatever. I can accept that. Also, FINALLY SPIDEY GOT REACTIVE EYES."
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,hey guys at least warn that there are tons of spoilers in this ! not everyone has read the comics. some people still like surprises in their movies

wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,"Does no one else think that the franchise is over-bloated CGI and recycled action, and too comic book heavy ?
I don't mind some of the marvel films, but they could be done better"
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,"Damnit, I wanted to see Murrel, Signore and Mundy's reaction to the trailer and I just get three guys I don't care about + annoying unfunny Rudnick. Too bad."

wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,Best revival ever in civil war
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,did you say the trailer showed antman running on an arrow because from what i saw they showed hawkeye shoot multiple arrows and then it shows antman in a separate scene running through ironman's hand.  It was two scenes cut together for the trailer
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,"I liked the trailer. I have no beef with any of it but with all the gifs and images of Spiderman that have been coming out I've noticed one thing. They are fighting on the tarmac at an airport, a place you might recognize as not having any tall structures, where does Spiderman swing in from?"
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,666 dislikes!!!!! illuminati confirmed
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,"I lost my shit when Spider-Man showed up! I wasn't sure about the costume at first but now I think it's great, it's classic yet modern and I love the shutter eyes. Oh and to people complaining that he's too CGI, it's just the trailer, it'll look better by the time the film releases. I'm so happy we're getting Spidey in the MCU! Can not wait for this film! :D"
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,"But I kinda don't like the idea of Stark making him a suit.

If he made an upgrade, sure.

But I'd still want the costume he wears to be the one he made himself. It shows his ability to excel despite lack of resources and experience, and independence in becoming a superhero all by himself at 15 without being a billionaire or a trained soldier/agent.

Also, I read somewhere that when writing the comics, Ditko specifically made Peter SEW his own costume, to pay tribute to his mother and hometown where he also learned to sew.

So (haha, unintentional rhyme) changing the suit's creation into being made by Stark with tech instead of Pete himself, at home, with his own hands; to me, feels like a betrayal to his wonderfully, carefully constructed backstory & origins, and by extension his writer/artist/creators :'("
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,This is one of those moment where I wish I can fast forward the time....
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,I want to bet that Batman V Superman will be better... just because I want it to be. Better for us nerds.
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,that spidey voice is terrible
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,"i dont get  why people hate the costume????? a first costume created by a kid is expected to be simple. Also being faithful to  comics. i love both marvel and dc (dc mainly THK TRILOGY). I think marvel is making great movies. i m hyped for bvs but seeing the second trailer my hyped metre dropped. Still i would watch it if reviews are good because BATMAN.
spiderman is not CG except his eyes and i am relieved that they showed him in trailer because:

1. i was really worried about him being included in civil war and spiderman being a 16 year old as i wanted it to be good.mow i think he MIGHT be great.
2. i m more hyped for the movie"
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,that was the best trailer ive seen been waiting to see spider man
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,"So you guys have no problem with Captain America, the beacon of righteousness, being on the wrong side and starting a civil war? And no problem with a weird CGI Spiderman with the lamest intro dialogue. Yeah you guys are not partial."
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,spidey looks and sounds amazing!
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,Honestly I would have loved Andrew Garfield to remain Spider-Man for this. But this is alright too.
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,"For those who are saying Spidey's suit is CG are wrong, only his eyes are CG like deadpool. The reason it appears like a CG model is because of the fabric used. It doesn't have the texture we are used to from the previous spiderman movies."
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,"For a movie that has a budget north of $200 million, the Spiderman CGI should really be better than that... Otherwise, given the movie's incredibly long run time, it looks like it's gonna be a fun movie."
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,"Great panel. Nice review. Personally I think the trailer was awesome enough without the reveal, though I totally  understand it. My problem here (apart from a very minor quibble about the look) is that Spidey looks and feels like an after thought, both in the trailer and the film production. I have nothing but hope that the big M will balance that out, story wise and visually in the actual film. I mean, he's the company mascot ffs! :D"
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,Didn't see this much energy when they were talking about the Ghost Busters movie XD
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,Bad CGI， unbearable 
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,I think that spider man has a built in zoom in zoom out mechanics in his suit reason why the eyes move that way he is under iron man he must have at least tech help from the guy hehe
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,I actually like it when the movies go away from the comics but I think age of ultron was a bit crappy

wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,"Lol @ acting like this movie will be anything like TDK in terms of tone or seriousness.  it's going to be cliche filled one line crap Marvel always throws at us with bright cheesy CGI.  Marvel is a joke, can't believe people think they make better movies than DC."
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,"I thought Stark said ""On the roost"", what was it he called Spidey?"
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,My two favourite parts were the Hawkeye/Ant-Man team-up and Spider-Man! Can't wait for this film
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,loool wtf did they do to the spider suit i think they hate spiderman it was perfect in spiderman 3 then it looked fake in amazing spiderman now its looks like playdoh.... wtf however its kinda needed for the expressive eyes like in the comics
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,Am I the only one who thinks Bucky still is brainwashed? or Something is still wrong with him? :/ I just get the feeling from the trailers that he has another evil agenda of his own
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,BvS all the way
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,Won't Anty Man on an arrow weigh it down?
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,You guys didn't talk about black panther
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,"i'm surprised, that no one considered the suit that Spidey wear in that trailer is either Iron Spider/Spider-Armor, it made this mechanical sound when it's eyes squints. I mean, we saw him on Tony's side(at least in that part of the movie shown in the trailer), and they can change the color, a gold-red Iron Spider isn't a must, Nick Fury is white in another universe too."
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,"Lol, I screamed orgasmly when I see Spidey, but his ""hey everyone"" voice kinda remind me of that 13 years old punk with 5$ headphone in COD"

wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,"Is the word Underruth? Whats the meaning of this word? In the German trailer he calls Spidy ""Kleiner"", wich would translate to shorty or better fitting youngster"
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,"Feels like they were under the gun or something, why so rushed cutting people off and not just let them talk, this is youtube not a 30 minute show where you have to time it"
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,"I hate when they do things like that montage. Seriously, if they didn't intervene during new york, the damage would have been worse. What was the goverment going to do against the chitauri? They were going to use a nuke, in an american city, that was still full of people, as their first option.

Same thing with washington. Their biggest, most trusted inteligence organization was roten from the inside, and was going to kill a lot of people if they were not stopped? Their decition? DO NOTHING! 

And sokovia? Oh yeah, a city dropped from the sky. You know what would have happened if they didn't stopped it? GLOBAL EXTINCTION.

They fear colateral damage without considering that everything could have been so much worse if they did nothing."
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,"You talk about spidey's eyes, and the two eras of spiderman because you're fanning out about this movie, but that's honestly the biggest comic book reference you're gonna get in this entire film... not to be a downer, it just happens like that in films like this"

wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,"Say what you will about The Amazing Spider-Man 2, but that Spider-Man suit was perfection. I'm not really sure how to feel about the new Spider-Man suit personally, it looks a little dated if you ask me."
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,"""Hey everyone.""
""Why did they use that take? You know, the worst one?"""
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,"Actually... I thought the spidy reveal was a bit let down.... because I was totally looking forward to having him in the Infinity war instead... they should have saved him for the BIG shot... and not just a late addition in the Caps movie...

BTW... what exactly did Ironman call spidy?"
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,"I don't get why everyone's excited about kid spider-man, he's in almost every screen adaptation. It's a reboot, I know, based on the ultimate universe, I know, and I'm tired of the high school story. I would have liked to see an older spider-man (not just the actor)."
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,awesome
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,so much attention to an ant man and not even a word about Bucky being a total ass and trying to shoot Tony in the face ? o_0
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,"How are these experts geeking out over that PS3 graphics costume??  I don't get it!!Oh...and that ''Hey everyone'' line seems very misplaced...this kid should be shitting his pants, not all ''Hey I'm so cool and I'm here...''  I hate the costume! They added the black detail just so it looked different from the previous movies...I am excited for this movie...but because I think it'll be waaaaaay much better than this trailer.  To me this trailer was a let down."
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,"Spider man is gonna die. He's a little shit, plus he died in the comics."
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,"My big dream is that they find a blond dude in that prison, that no one really know where came from.
*cough*Sentry*Cough* 

Would't THAT be an rather interesting movie?"
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,"The Spider-man reveal was like the Vision reveal in the final trailer for Avengers Age of Ultron, good marketing. It's enough to create hype and sell more tickets. And I have nothing against that."
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,Spidermans eyes work like shutter. I love how its more techy thant Just plain cgi like Deadpool. perfect

wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,"The suit is practical only the eyes are cgi. If you look at the high-res images you can tell its practical.




That was for all you DC trolls"
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,Underuse? As in under used? :P
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,If you're leaning  on your left elbow like this comment.
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,Strongly felt that the Spidey costume should have been like the ASM2 rather than the comic version.
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,"So hard to restrain optimism and excitement...I don't want to go in believing it'll be the best movie Marvel's made yet, but like the magic 8-ball said, all signs point to YES!!!"

wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,"Can you really call it a war though? Because so far it just seem like a battle, it lacks a sense of grandeur"
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,Spiderman coming in with the worst line in the trailer.
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,"I don't know if it will be the same this time around, but I have noticed a pattern with many of the recent MCU movies: Trailers come out, show grim tone with ominous music, fans speculate and praise movie for taking a mature direction with the universe, movie comes out and is pretty much tonally identical to any of the Phase 1 movies. They're all still entertaining, but the formula is beginning to stagnate. Will Civil War finally change things up? Maybe, but if not, we'll still have the Defenders on Netflix and DC's offerings to as a superhero palette cleanser."
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,i cant belive these guys like this new spider man the cgi was terrible and when he spoke i thought it was Justin Beiber
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,"I feel like I'm the only person hype to see Crossbones. He's my second favorite Avengers villain, right under Dr. Doom."
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,"do you really not see your double bias?? superman had one movie where he destroyed a city and he was the poison of the planet; the avengers advertise their destruction three movies long and it's ""deep and substantial""....?!?! spiderman looks like a cartoon placed out of 1950, CGI placed out of 1990, but you lose your mind because his tiny eyes squint smaller?! The Amazing Spider-man 2 had a more classic looking Spider-man; why can nobody acknowledge that??????? you were my favorite movie channel, but I now see where this ""marvel bias"" comes from...the end, I guess"
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,Can't wait to see Spidey to defeat puberty 😂😂😂

wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,They should have kept spider man a secret
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,"As much as I absolutely love this Spider-Man outfit, because honestly I think it looks marvel-ous, the spider symbol is a bit too small especially in comparison to the rest of his chest. I might be being a bit nitpicky but it's just how I feel about it."
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,God this is so annoying
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,"They really needed to show us Spiderman? They couldnt have left it for 
when we saw the movie? This isnt going to make us see it any more than 
what we already wanted to see it.

This is like when the 2nd 
trailer for BatmanVSuperman came out and they showed Doomsday... Ya you 
couldve left it out of the trailer."
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,i was not excited to see the spider man reveal. the other two iterations of spiderman were live action suits (for the most part) and this reveal looked very CGI and cartoony. not impressed. loved the rest of the trailer though.
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,I feel like they got Spidey right with the eyes.
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,The scene where Warmachine is shut down is after the airport scene. When you see Tony holding Warmachine you can see the airport on fire in the background.
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,I love the new spiderman costume because it's a callback to the very first spiderman costume in the comics
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,I do not see what all the Spiderman fuss is about. We've seen him in 5 other movies already. Him being in the MCU doesn't change that or make the character any more exciting. I thought Black Panther was more impressive.
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,"That guy with the Black Jacket's Rocking that Steven Strange Goatee like a Boss! This movie is going to be Epically Awesome! I love Cap ever since I was young and he has the Better Trilogy. But I kinda have to give to Tony he does have 2 of the Better Heroes Spidey, & Panther. Also got to love the Symbolic nature of Spidey Holding Cap's shield that's something I wanted to see happen in Live-Action since I was 8 and Marvel literally said Here You Go!"
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,No mention of Black Panther ☹️

wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,You think they'll use pym particles for prison 42 in place of the phantom zone?
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,"My 8 year old son squealed and clapped because Spidey is his absolute FAVORITE superhero.  He writes his own comics for his friends at school, and I don't think he ever would have thought of it if not for Spidey."
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,will there be another trailer or is it last?
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,"I have to be honest, I was kind of upset that they showed Spider-Man in this trailer. It will still be one of the best parts of the movie but it would have been better if we didn't see it beforehand. And now everyone is just excited about him instead of the story and the emotion between our heroes who are already established in the MCU"
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,awesome
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,In the MCU they only have one living villain on earth: the abomination

wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,"It really funny how they are fanboying all over Civil War and didn't mention out some flaws in trailer. But when BvS came, they started bashing it all over the place. Smh, these kind of fanboys are the reason why DC and Marvel can't co exist and they are giving Marvel a bad name."

Tom Holland Avenger Spiderman Team up together along with Spider Gwen & spiderman miles morales. This would be just fun & A way to introduce the multiverse."

wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,"Ok, these Marvel movies are supposed to be in the ""real"" world (as in live-action), so why  the hell is Spider-man's mask animated? Are they going for ""dark and gritty"" or str8 comic book? What's going on here?"
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,Spiderman looks so CGI... kinda disappointing
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,#teamspidey
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,I can't believe you guys praised the texture of spider-man's suit...
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,"Spider-Man's eyes aren't for expression like Deadpool's. This version of the suit is more tech-based and he has cameras that can zoom where the eyes are, which is likely what the narrowing of the eyes is (you can also hear the mechanical sound of the eyes)."
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,spiderman sounds like a little middle school baby in this trailer. that is WRONG!!!!!!!!!
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,"You realise that the previous trailer spoiled the death of two people, right?

Bucky (inaudible - lip reading): Steve's gone!

Yeah, Bucky is Cap 2.0 now... and, of course, we have Rodey's(sp?) death."
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,"I'm so happy spiderman is in an MCU movie but... the suit. who thought it was a good idea, it looks neon. They should have shot for a Deadpool look in terms of colour and filter."

wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,"I still love the screen junkies show but, i miss the old set I don't know why they don't use it"

wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,"Guys! what if the black lines in spiderman's suit are the things that unite the suit. I had thought of a spidey suit that has parts and you put on the boots and they close like a zipper or something so they can't drop in mid-air while swinging by in new york xD.
Because think about it! In the comics they're boots and, well, they can fell off. But I don't kno, do you guys think that's the case? I really hope so."
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,Im hoping the reason they're hiding spiderman so much is because he get the Iron Spider suit
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,"Pardon my lack of knowledge in Marvel, but where's Hulk and what side he takes ?"

wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,"Spider-Man looks like complete shit. It's Marvel's equivalent of DC's shitty Green Lantern suit. Comparing the sheild in his hand to the rest of his body, he just looks fake."
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,"That was a great panel, you should have them all on movie fights(again?)"
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,"I really hope that spiderman outfit changes within the movie... I'm a die hard spideyfan but being honest I like the superior spiderman outfit over this one and I really hate the superior spiderman outfit. I mean his outfit looks way to unrealistic considering everything that's going on, it seems so out of place... I got to give the eyes some props though.
Not liking the red webbing either... I like the outfit but I don't ike how unrealistic it seems, it looks like a cartoon and everyone else has great details on their outfits."

wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,#teamunderoos
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,"Best Spider Man costume to date. Very much classic Spidey, and we finally get the expression eyes that was sorely lacking in the last five movies. Sorry fake fans, Deadpool stole them from Spider Man, who has been doing it since Amazing Fantasy. But if you picked up an actual Spider Man book prior to 2007 you'd know that."
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,It's weird that 4 grown ass men are getting hard on's for a 16 yo boy.  Spider Man was only a teen in the comics for like 18 months of his 50 YEAR publication history.  Marvel had one job and they completely fucked it up.  This Spider Man is trash. #WeWantAndrewGarfield
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,"Bad CGI figure in DC movie -> instant hate.

wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,"This trailer had everything I wanted. Tonally and thematically. I'm that much more excited for this movie! If this turns out as great as The Winter Soldier did (as it's certainly looking that way thus far), I can say with certainy that the Russo Bros. are the best thing to happen to the MCU.

Also, on the topic of Spider-Man, I'll admit I wasn't as taken by his costume until watching this. Seeing Coy talk about the Romita, Snr./Ditko eyes has certainly swayed me more to the look."

wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,It looks like for me Captain America is the bad guy for me in this movie!
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,keep up the good work love your guys vids
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,"Love Spidey's new eyes but I'm a little on the fence about the rest of the costume, especially the new insignia. Then again, I didn't like Batman's new costume when it was first revealed and now it's grown on me so maybe this will be alright. As for Rhodes' potential fate? If he dies, who cares. The MCU is extremely cheap when it comes to hero deaths so if he bites it in this movie he'll just be back again in the next one"
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,"Lol😂, marvel will probably put the whole production crew of the new fantastic 4 movie in prison 42, that's how they will fill it up."
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,"Something that i thought about... if you listen closely when spider mans eyes get smaller, you can hear it makes a little buzz noise so i believe that the suit is a lot more modernized in terms of tech and i think tony kinda re-vamped his suit since it seems as though they are on the same team.  idk just a thought xD"
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,"I´d spend a whole day with Matt just to count how many times he says ""Doctor Strange"". Love his passion fo rthe character."
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,How come Batman v superman trailer reaction video was only 7 minutes and Civil War gets 17 min ?!!
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,Looks and feels amazing unlike that DC movie with Bats and Supes
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,wow oscar isaac lost alot of weight
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,"I love Tom Holland's voice as Spiderman, but I absolutely HATE the suit"
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,"""all aboard the hype-train!"""
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,Really dislike the costume for Spidey and it did diminish my hype a bit but I'm still way more excited for this than Batman V. Superman.
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,it's Kylo Ren on the right
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,Who plays spiderman in the movie
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,there wasn't enough said about Black Panther. It's his debut too 😢
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,That guy on the far right somewhat looks and speaks like adam driver. Now I can't get out of my head that kylo ren is talking about the new captain amerca movie hahahah
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,"Also, I think the Spider-Man reveal was smart because 1.) It reassures the people who weren't entirely convinced Spider-Man was even going to be in the movie and 2.) It'll make a lot more people want to see the movie who probably weren't as excited to see it as others to begin with. Mostly because Spider-Man is one of the most iconic Marvel characters and people who aren't necessarily as invested in Iron Man or Captain America or the Avengers will want a sneak peak at how Marvel is going to handle Spider-Man's character."
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,"I'm not going to lie....I dislike the new Spider-Man costume. It looks horribly fake, and it lakes texture. I know the moving eyes are comic accurate, but they look a little weird in the way they did them. I personally would have gone for a black and red costume with the web underarm wings."
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,holy shit that guy looks like an older beat up kylo ren
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,shouldn't scarlet witch be in prison for making the hulk raged out killing all those people?
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,"Also the SpiderMan costume .. was better in both previous renditions of Spider Man.  This is very comic booky, where the rest have new modern looks."
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,LISTEN! I saw Ant-Man on that arrow and I made the most inhuman noise possible. Also Spider-Man.
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,"Except Justice League does go into the global scale discussion of damage.. look at how two spots on the globe were partially teraformed....  I feel like people give props to Marvel for the same shit DC does, and yet says that DC does something wrong even though marvel does the same thing... people just want to be marvel fan boys"
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,"I'm very hesitant to get excited about this movie, cause when the Age of Ultron trailer dropped it looked just as dark and gritty but turned out to be super disappointing."
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,This trailer got me hyped for the movie!!! Spiderman my favorite im glad he finally in the mcu!!! BUT WILL THE HULK MAKE AN APPEARANCE IN THIS MOVIE!!! Dat wud b a shocker
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,"wow, only fanboys."

wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,My reaction to spiderman reveal HELL YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA WOOOOHOOOOOOOOOOO
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,"Just saying, but if they didn't constantly kill all of their villains, that fancy prison would look more interesting. Imagine Ross talking to Tony about being too powerful and they're standing in front of a glass cell with a heavily sedated _Blonsky_ hooked up to heart monitors."
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,"**Scarlet Witch holds a cry**

wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,"I honestly didn't expect them to show Spidey at all, so I watched the trailer with muted excitement, especially by the time it got to the end I had given up, but when they threw in that reveal at the end, I totally giggled like a school boy and started crying. I've been rewatching the trailer and trailer reactions ever since. I don't think I've ever watched a trailer so many times. I don't know why I love it so much but I do."

wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,"The trailer looks dumber than Avenger 2 trailer, which by itself was a ""meh"" movie. RDJ so far is the only reason to watch the movie, looks like his character progresses a lot. 
Sorry, but BvS looks like a bigger and more serious movie than this. Civil war looks like s Expendables 3 with 1st and 2nd tier used up superheroes, with Spidey appearing like Chuck Norris just to drag some kinds into cinema. And Spidey looks cheap (CGI'sh).  :/"
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,These middle aged manchildren are sitting in a room squealing and discussing about children's movie? Jesus Christ millennials are going to take us back to the dark age.
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,I like spiderman I just felt that they gave him a Wonderwoman like entrance in Dawn of Justice which I was not a fan of.

wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,"I feel like they should have just left it at Spidey stealing Cap's shield without showing him (the silhouette of the leg as he jumps over is okay). Draw out the tease a bit longer.

Otherwise? Great trailer!"

wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,I'm so proud of bae right now!
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,Hope this film doesn't do a age of ultron and be extremely average. There's more heroes and side characters in this than the last avengers and that felt like a fight over screen time. Be good!!!!
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,"I can understand the mixed feelings on the spidey suite, but I think it'll end up growing on a lot of people, myself included, and bear in mind that this is only a single shot from a single scene in the film. Give it time guys."
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,Lol too much circlejerking. Get some different view retards. Spiderman looked like a cheap plastic toy.

wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,Why are people bitching about spider-man looking fake when spider-man is fake so why should he look real if he isn't real. He's a fictional character :/
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,"Not going through all the comments, but I can NOT be the only guy who is thinking that why are Spidey's eyes able to close. He is wearing a mask. The mask should not change in anyway."
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,It's mostly the lighting in the scene with spider man looking shitty.
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,I did not watch it yet.

wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,"Hey, I have a small theory. It's a bit weird that they would show a death in a trailer, so a lot of people think it's a fake. But what if War Machine DOES die but, he might not be the ONLY death. This would have people think that one death would make all the other characters safe, but then BAM!! another one dead. I think this would enrage A LOT of people but it could happen. Though an argument against my own theory would be that it diminishes the importance of the first death so I'm not so sure."
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,"What is all this hype with antman on an arrow? It's not that interesting. Black panther taking out the winter on a motorcycle is more badass, along with 50 other things in the trailer."

I've seen the whole movie already!.... oh wait a minute... no one cares? oh yeah, because it's marvel. god forbid it is criticized."
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,the spiderman costume si shit i hate !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,spider man looks pretty cool
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,It was boring and spider-man was cgi looking (just too stand there). But you guys go ahead earn your marvel pay checks and jerk to it.
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,"Potential Massive Spoiler Alert!!!
=========
In the trailer
1:42 Look behind Cap, there is a Bucky, and to the right in that chair thing there is another Bucky.
There are (at least) two Bucky in the movie, that's why Bucky says ""I didn't do it"" and Cap says ""People think you did""!"
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,I liked the reveal of doomspiderday it was outta no where !!! And the costume was amazing the cgi was not garbage shit what's so ever...
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,You guys convinced me of how cool the Spider suit is
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,Knew Rudnick couldn't resist a Garfield blow. Honestly his criticism in the past Movie Fights of that was pretty annoying.
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,Hector looks like nick from new girl
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,"Screen junkies always has awesome discussions, Hal is a great host, and the production is always top notch. Keep up the great work!"
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,Where is Swamp Thing?????????
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,Nerdgasm. I thought I made that up but obviously I'm not alone
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,"I like that they casted an actual KID as spiderman. Not some handsome, charming, tall actor. Holland looks like that weird kid from middle school nobody cared to talk too. That really is who Peter Parker was. That's why I and so many other Spidey fans liked Tobey. He was a weird schoolboy-dofus without the costume."
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,"i love spidey's new look, but i feel the look doesn't fit in with the rest of the heroes"
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,the cgi on spiderman doesn't seem 100% done to me... The design is great but the cgi animation looks a bit cartoony/rubbery if you know what I mean? It doesn't look like Spiderman is part of the scene around him
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,"powerful hal ""bye bye"" rudnick ladies and genetlemen!"
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,CGI spiderman
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,This will not be the last trailer.
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,Why did Spider-Man sound like a little kid
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,"""Any thoughts about Scarlet Witch and Vision?""
""They're gonna fall in love and have a baby!!!!""
Me: SIT DOWN ASSHOLES ITS TIME TO DROP KNOWLEDGE THEY DO HAVE KIDS! BILLY KAPLAN AND TOMMY SHEPHERD! YOUNG AVENGERS!"
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,Whatttttt? Emotion and depth to a marvel movie? Finally!!!!!! They're stepping up they're game from just plain old action movies to hopefully movies with more to them. I can't wait
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,Best Spider-Man Costume so far! Finally!!! Eyes with personality and the webbing on the costume is perfect. Nerdgasm! Haters gonna hate. BVS is gunna blow. Just sayin.
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,It showed to much why aren't you complaining about that.
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,"After reading these comments, I can't help but ask:
Am I the only one that...






hates when the toilet water splashes on your nutsack?"
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,hopefully they see this and give those moving white eyes to batman
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,Does anyone know where i could get the shirt can Coy Jandreau (the short guy with a buzzcut) is wearing? I really like that artwork.
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,"I mean I can understand deadpools eyes being animated with the depth and protruding of his eyes sticking out, but spidermans eyes have no depth, no raised eye pieces, just one layer and cgi eyes, it doesn't fit properly, there has to be something there to make his eyes look believable and not just one all over layer. And not to mention his suit looks like the exact same material as the rest of the avengers outfits. Sack the clothing department"
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,"Like I say, marvel studios have timed all films and shows in the wrong order and in the wrong year. If we had daredevil in 2014, daredevil season 2 in 2015. We could have had jessica jones, luke cage, gold faced guy and daredevil and the new punisher all in this civil war film, but no they have scarlet witch and vision to make it look ""bigger"" and if they just stuck with Andrew and bought him over M.S, (fucked him over) and then had Tony telling spidey it's ok to take off the mask, after this whole gwen Stacy death getting to him and he has Tony to comfort him, all of that could have looked good on screen, even having an amazing spiderman 3 with just solely on venom and could have had him in civil war. But the timing and release is all wrong"
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,Aaaaaaaahhhhhhhh!!??!!??!??!
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,my spidey sense tells me it's tingling and i'll spray my webs all over the place on a big round shield...
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,"shock to screen junkies being biased marvel fan boys. All of them are. hal, Jon bailey, Andy signore, all of them are biased fan boys. The suit is yeah 1960s but there's an idea of something and then actually seeing it on screen and how it actually looks. The tone for the spidey looks wrong with the contrast. just awful. give it back to sony. Andrew Garfield can make more facial expressions and emotion  through his mask just by body language. They're not letting tom use full facial expressions and relying on cgi to help him out."
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,Red is the new black duh
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,eyes make him look like deadpool
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,Not that I'm complaining but I'm curious about what people think about Black Widows confrontation with Stark. She is sort of defensive with him and says he needs to watch his back but then sides with him...? Thoughts!
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,spidey looks stupid
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,That son of a gun!!! Haha these lads are brilliant in a super nerdy type of way!
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,Where's Kevin Smith goddamnit!?
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,"I also love how in man of steel metropolis is destroyed and everyone flips out.  in the mcu new York, sacovia, and Washington DC is destroyed and no one bats an eye."
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,"I loved the Spidey reveal, but I reckon it could've worked if they cut to black straight after the web hit the shield, just to tease that little bit more, and then actually show him in the final trailer right before the movie drops. but each to their own I guess"
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,I like the suit it looks exactly how it suppose to look
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,"They should have left Spiderman a surprise. And by that, I meant they never should have even announced that he'd be in the movie"
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,"I'm gonna wait until the movie comes out to properly judge the new spiderman, the suit honestly looks nice, I don't see why people hate this.  Would people have freaked out even more if spidey appeared in the iron spider suit? since its something that the casual fans would not know about."
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,uhm . . keanu reeves gained a lil weight?
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,I like that I can relate to you guys
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,Who thinks Thanos will be in the end credits?
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,"Ok...I clearly remember, I believe it was on Movie Fights, that they were raving that they were keeping Spider-Man out of the trailers. Because it would be a great surprise for the masses, the non die hard fans who don't follow these things too closely. They negatively compared BvS (of course) for showing too much and how CWar was doing it the right way...I'm seeing both films, I don't give a crap about Marvel v DC; but seriously, the bias shows, at least stay consistent."
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,Geeks need to realize that they reveal these characters because they're not trying to sell us. We're already sold. We've been sold since the movie was announced. They are selling those general movie-goers who aren't informed on everything going on with these studios. guaranteed the won over a ton of people with that reveal.
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,"I'm surprised they  slept on the Black panther chase scene. That scene showcased that the MCU is gonna make him stronger and faster than Captain america like in the comics. That s what they need. Black Panther in comics is half Batman's, half captain america and complete badass."
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,am I the only one that's afraid that spiderman is going to be shoe horned into this movie???
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,*MARVEL*'s marketing campaign has seriously overshadowed Batman v Superman this year!

wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,Thanks for talking about black panther ...
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,I think marvel nailed this trailer
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,just got me hyped for Spidy!
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,"That's a lot of awesomeness in 2:25 trailer. Couple thoughts:1. Am I disappointed in the spidey reveal? Not at all, if you were going to be revealed, I think that was the perfect way to do it. 2. Ant Man on the Arrow, epic. Giant Man or Antman, I wanted to see one!3. Captain America gets that snot beat out of him pretty good. . . . . . All by Iron man or was he jumped(as they did Iron man before)4. Barren Zemo? Good save not showing him. 5. No way rhodey is dead, 2 trailers and the same scene, very not dead, hurt? Comatose? Sure. Dead? don't think so. (of course I'm guessing). Favorite Trailer in the last year?"

wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,Youtube comments make me wish abortions were legal in all 50 states. Spidey looks great.
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,Just give me planet hulk and world war hulk
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,I actually don't like the way Spider Man's costume looks. It think it looks bland...or something. Can't really explain it...I just think they could've done a better job with it.
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,i am the only one who doesn't really care about spiderman? :V ...Pritty damn sure that i am the only one xD

wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,"The Fat Spider is on the back of the suit!!! Freeze it around 2:17 in the trailer, right before he lands with the shield."

wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,this video is just a bunch of nerds talking over eachother 😧
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,"The reveal was good because it wipes those rumors that he was an after credit scene, and builds better hype than that mystery alone did.  Now people want to see what he does, not just see if he's even a part of things.  I hadn't noticed the eyes before, but that was so great to have it noted and close up on it."
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,Star Wars Ep. VIII spoiler: Kylo Ren's father is actually Matt Key.

wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,"Hands down the best Spidey suit ever. He has the belt, the eyes, the flat black webs, and best of all, the fat spider on his back. It's the most faithful and beautiful."
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,Why do I feel that Spiderman is going to be irrelevant in this movie?
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,Hector is literally so excited he can't speak...
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,Why many dislikes
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,Why didn't they break down the last Batman v Superman trailer? And then they say they're not biased
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,"Loved when Cap told Iron Man , ""I can do this all day.""
It's a perfect callback to part one (Evans even looks like he moves his body in perfect sync with his previous performance) and it lets you know exactly how he thinks/feels about Stark in that one line."
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,"My problem with this trailer besides the reveal of Spiderman, technically Ant-Man can't ride because according to its own science, his amount of atoms doesn't change so his weight doesn't change so the arrow shouldn't be able to fly straight and he shouldn't have been able to run on Iron Man's arm. Actually, why did they bring up this science in the first place? They only showed it work like once. Honestly, I don't understand why superhero movies try to use real world logic, just create some crazy mumbo jumbo that doesn't exist, or don't even explain the Pym Particle, just say it shrinks people."
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,You guys were rushing so much..... STAHP

wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,"F ing nerdgasm for the whole day. I squealed through the whole trailer, but Spidey, Ant Man on the Arrow and Wanda and the Vision just, wow."
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,"Okay I haven't seen any Spider-Man films, I understand the premise of it but there have been so many remakes and or reboots. Anyway my question is which series are marvel taking as cannon for the MCU which timeline are they saying yep that actually happened"
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,"Pretty pumped, but admittedly a tad concerned that Captain America will get lost in all the world building and setting up of future films."
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,"fairly sure The Raft was shown in Agents Of SHIELD when Winter Soldier affected the show, and it looked nothing like that submersible building(?). so my guess is that was Prison 42 or what 42 has turned into for the MCU"
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,"Hector looks like Mexican Oscar

wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,I might be the only person who is a Spider-Man fan and likes the TASM 2 suit better. I like this suit but still prefer the TASM 2 suit.

wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,"Great point about selling tickets with Spiderman.  I kinda didn't want to see Spiderman but it really just makes total sense.
Great vid.
Next point could have been ""Do we think Cap dies?""  I'd go with yes and ""I could do this all day"" might be his last words.
Evans has 1 more movie in his contract after this but there are 2 infinity wars.  Maybe have a big reveal in pt. 2  cause no one in comics stays dead.  I wouldn't be surprised to see Quicksilver back either."
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,"I liked the trailer, but the spiderman part was bad, suit looks way too cgi, the changing eye size was pointless (at least in that scene) and random, and he sounded like a 10 year old boy"

wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,I don't know what William Hurt is talking about. According to Marvelites destruction and death only happens in Man of Steel.
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,"There should be a complete MCU video game(a good one, not like Thor, captain america, or iron man)"
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,Spidey has to voice crack in that scene and then stand up cough and gag a little and go back into the pose and resay that phrase hey everyone
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,"I decided to write this before i watched the video so i don't know if they say anything about this, but has any one else noticed that Cap is one of the least responsible for any of the damage that happened in any of films besides Black Widow and Hawkeye?

Iron Man 1-3 mostly Tony's fault
Thor 1 and 2 somewhat Thor's fault
Hulk Bruce's fault to a degree
Captain America 1 and 2 are both Hydra's fault, Cap not having much involvement besides letting Bucky get turned into the Winter Solider (though in all honesty if you saw your friend fall off a train down a mountain in the middle of winter you would probably think he was dead too.) 
Avengers 1 sort of Thor's fault maybe a hint of Cap for letting the Tesseract get away in Cap 1
and Avengers 2 being mostly Tony and a little bit of Bruce as well as Thor. 

Though all in all I guess this would explain Tony's motivation and Steve's disagreement.

Anyway sorry for the long rant I just had to get that off my chest!"
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,"I'm more excited for Civil War than BvS. Granted I'll see BvS and I will be excited as a DC Fan to see it, but the MCU has built a world, it's characters for years now. I am emotionally invested in in the MCU right now and to see that family in disarray, for me, is more more climactic than being introduced to a new comic universe. Knowing that DC is starting a new universe makes the stakes for that movie feel lower because obviously those heroes will make it. Civil War feels like the culmination of an episodic series near its final act. The stakes are higher, new characters are being introduced, and the old characters may finally end their arcs."

wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,Guys. I think the Spider-Man's suit is what Tony made him so it's more high tech and hides his identity better. The mask is sorta like a tv. It just projects his mask on like a screen on the mask. I don't really know how to explain it in words. That's just my theory anyway. He's supposed to have two suits in the movie. His makeshift one and the on one Tony made him

wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,No one is talking about how much nerfing needs to be done on some of the characters knowing how powerful most of them are. Unless they are playing off the whole no one really wants to kill each other at the end.
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,"Typical of Screen Junkies. Complaining that BvS showed Doomsday and Wonder Woman too early but praising that Marvel showed Spiderman early (both on trailer 2).

wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,I would trust The Russo Brothers with my life
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,I came to that trailer
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,"I still fear this movie might fall into the ultron trap of being overstuffed and under developed. So many characters and so much going on to make work in a 2-3 hour movie. They are introducing Spidey, Black Panther, Baron Zemo, in costume crossbones on top of the central conflict with all the existing characters. 

I still have hope due to the last trailer making it seem like this was still going to revolve mainly around captain america and not get lost trying to be avengers 3."
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,Did they animate Spiderman in 2006 and then wait ten years for the rest of the movie?
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,I really like the costume design and love the idea of a younger spidey
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,"I believe that Spiderman would be the greatest reveal for this trailer. Just like the anticipation behind Deadpool and it coming to the big screen in the right way, I believe because this has been something on the minds of people for so long and to see it come to pass is fulfilling.  i love the way marvel has done it because unlike some, they still have cards that they are holding onto for the movie goers to be surprised by.  Here is something I am wondering, With Spiderman, is his eyes the only part of the suit that may be mechanical (i.e. Iron Spider)."
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,i was excited to see spidy...but the costume looked plastic and full of cg...i hope the finishing touches are left...
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,I really hope the end credits scene for Civil War is just JK Simmons as J Jonah Jameson yelling at Parker for pictures of Spiderman
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,Spidey was fire kin awesome he was like ya I'm here and I was like oh hell freiking
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,this trailer was like the first dawn of justice trailer: giving too much away of the plot. Spiderman appearing is like showing han solo getting killed in the trailer.

wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,"Alright people, I know the excitement is getting to our heads a bit, but let's take a deep breath and set the record straight. This is NOT the best live-action Spider-Man costume we have seen, it is the SECOND best. The best looking costume is still the one from The Amazing Spider-Man 2.

This is coming from someone who has been a Spider-Man lover since he was 4 years old. The design is really good, and I'm really glad they went with the cartoony spider logo instead of a realistic looking one, but this is NOT the best Spider-Man suit we could have gotten (which is fine). I'm extremely confident that the portrayal of the character will be the best one we've seen yet, and that is enough for me. Just because TASM2 was a shitty movie doesn't mean people should be afraid to admit that the costume was fantastic."

wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,"Why are they even fighting? The reason why they're fighting gets less and less clear with everything they release! It literally looks like Ironman just wants them to stop causing so much damage and wants to put Bucky in jail for all of the illegal acts he's committed (and he has a point considering that we watched Bucky kill multiple people and someone has to be punished for that) while Cap just doesn't want his friend to go to jail! Why are people choosing sides?!?!?! There's basically nothing to fight about! It's literally Cap convincing a bunch of people to break the law with him! I really hope I'm wrong, but this movie really just looks like they pulled a random reason for them to fight out of their butts!"

wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,Damnit Schick go away!
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,"The movie seems to have the same problems that Age Of Ultron had, only adding more red flags that come with the bad spidey CGI and a subpar story. Also, with only a handful of heroes going at each other can we really call this a 'war'?? Does marvel even have enough aptitude to make a serious story rather then continual light-hearted banter with no real conflict.

This just makes me all the more worried about Infinity Gauntlet if they are only gonna have a handful of characters and continue making conflicts/villains comedy relief. I'm kinda getting burned out with these repetitive PG Marvel movies. Civil War just seems very bland without the shock and craziness that the comic had (suburb getting blown up by B-class hero team, villains working for the pro-Ironman coalition,  deaths on both sides, the conflict of heroes revealing their identities and the conflicts with it, etc.) or the amount of characters that made it so war like."

Thank you Marvel for an awesome trailer.
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,Ungrateful brats anyone and everyone who complains about Spider-Man. Can you guys not appreciate how sick it is we finally have Spider-Man appear alongside all the other avengers? Ffs

wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,"Yeah, the whole thing with Tony taking the approach he does is very believable. Especially after the events of Iron Man 3 where he learned first hand what his own recklessness can do/ cause. It would make sense that he would be up for any form of control and check to ensure that kind of mass destruction doesn't happen again."
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,HATERS HAVE A ROOOOOOYAL SEAT...pretty sure the CGI will be more than cleaned up before the movie drops. Relax.

wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,i feel like they just copy DC's trailer 2 when they show up Mr Doomsday
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,So I guess I'm the only person who honestly doesn't like the look of the Spider-Man costume.﻿
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,Spider man broke the internet.

wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,"Hal, shave them arms."
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,So glad I saw the trailer before I checked my subscription list. Such an awesome reveal at the end of the trailer. Audibly gasped and geeked out. I feel sorry for anyone who just had it ruined by a terrible thumbnail/video title.

wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,My favorite part was Ant-Man on the arrow!
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,I was waiting for seven hours after i woke up to see the trailer. Anyone else?
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,Spidey was perfect!!!!
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,I think the eyes are actually cameras installed by Stark not like Deadpool where the eyes were shown to be moving to show emotion
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,Love the trailer but Spiderman was out of place. CGI looked terrible
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,"I know that the CGI of this movie is still a work in progress and it'll look much better in the finished product, but they really could've put more effort into the first official reveal of Spidey in the MCU... He looks like a character from a rather good video game."
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,I like the simplicity of the spidey suite brings me back to the old days
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,The new Spider-Man costume looks like my action figure

wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,"Why are these kids crying about how Spiderman looks? He looks fine, top whining."
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,You guys are so cynical and ungrateful. Be glad you have Spider-Man at all in this movie. The costume looks great and I'm sure Tom Holland will be great too.
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,The webbing is missing on the shield - I guess he rips it off - the top black boot line is the worst part of an otherwise great costume
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,MY BOY HECTOR FOR SUPERHERO NEWS!

wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,The suit looks like it came from party city!

wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,I miss the older days of Screen Junkies when it wasn't all panels and shit.
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,Spiderman's costume and voice feel like a step back. Very apprehensive about his role.

6FGCpGNld0s,Worst Movie of Summer 2018?! MOVIE FIGHTS!,I think that’s TFA is what Joe says “just a clash of stuff we have seen before with people who made it going: please like it!” The more I thought about it and after seeing it multiple times TFA is the most disappointing out of the new ones because it’s just a remake of New Hope
6FGCpGNld0s,Worst Movie of Summer 2018?! MOVIE FIGHTS!,"...man, that Wes Anderson Bond film would be really entertaining. Good? Maybe. True to the franchise? Probably not. But I'd enjoy it."

6FGCpGNld0s,Worst Movie of Summer 2018?! MOVIE FIGHTS!,Solo was not bad. It is probably the most fun Star Wars movie ever. I was skeptical about it but it surprised me
6FGCpGNld0s,Worst Movie of Summer 2018?! MOVIE FIGHTS!,idk if its youtube compression but im watching at 720 and it looks 480p. Hilarious episode.
6FGCpGNld0s,Worst Movie of Summer 2018?! MOVIE FIGHTS!,I really enjoyed solo and Jurassic world

6FGCpGNld0s,Worst Movie of Summer 2018?! MOVIE FIGHTS!,"Solo movie was hands down the worst movie attempt ever. Disney was simply seeking to suck out every last drop they could out of the character and it shows in their pathetic attempt at a second Rogue One. Why won't they learn? If Harrison Ford doesn't want to keep going with it, then STOP. Do some other fucking character."
6FGCpGNld0s,Worst Movie of Summer 2018?! MOVIE FIGHTS!,I like solo and fallen kingdom ;-;
6FGCpGNld0s,Worst Movie of Summer 2018?! MOVIE FIGHTS!,Damien Chazelle is a really interesting pick
6FGCpGNld0s,Worst Movie of Summer 2018?! MOVIE FIGHTS!,Best movie of the summer... all 3 I haven't even heard of.  Wow... really?  I like SJ but sometimes I'm guessig you guys are just a bunch of Oscar-bait lovers.
6FGCpGNld0s,Worst Movie of Summer 2018?! MOVIE FIGHTS!,Someone save me 1 hour 25mins and 19 seconds and summarize the agreed worst movies of Summer 2018 please. Thank you.
6FGCpGNld0s,Worst Movie of Summer 2018?! MOVIE FIGHTS!,Is that a Jojo's reference?
6FGCpGNld0s,Worst Movie of Summer 2018?! MOVIE FIGHTS!,God this show has become a sad parody of itself.

I ended up dreaming that these guys were debating at my grandma's living room at Chrismas, with live audience. Then somebody took my welcome gift bag and these guys stopped the show to make sure everything was ok.'."
6FGCpGNld0s,Worst Movie of Summer 2018?! MOVIE FIGHTS!,Solo was a really fun movie and Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom had some falts but other wise it was pretty good.
6FGCpGNld0s,Worst Movie of Summer 2018?! MOVIE FIGHTS!,"Joe, it is pretty clear that you hate star wars now. You attack it every chance you get to the point that I can't tell if you're trolling. My recommendation, stop watching star wars movies. They are clearly not for you and I work in a comic store in Chicago and there were 22 customers who were screen junkies fans that would come in and talk about your channel. Your abject hatred of all star wars movies to the point that you try to get them to stop making them has single-handedly reduced that number to 7. Think about it, if 15 people quit watching because of you in just one comic store, imagine how many that is worldwide. Great business plan Joe."

6FGCpGNld0s,Worst Movie of Summer 2018?! MOVIE FIGHTS!,Love the Wes Anderson directing Bond idea.

6FGCpGNld0s,Worst Movie of Summer 2018?! MOVIE FIGHTS!,I would love to stage Dead Poets Society in an arena theater
6FGCpGNld0s,Worst Movie of Summer 2018?! MOVIE FIGHTS!,"Everything Joe Starr said about Solo is how I feel about the Last Jedi. It is really hard to take the magic out of Star Wars, but TLJ certainly did it for me. Solo was neither great nor garbage, but what it did have is some of the Star wars feel to it. It is a film you go see & then forget. The Last Jedi is a film I wish I could forget or better still go back in time & never watch in the first place."
6FGCpGNld0s,Worst Movie of Summer 2018?! MOVIE FIGHTS!,"Just started watching this episode, Lons idea in the beginning would be so Meta and awesome, A couple times a year you guys should really do a “Cram it” episode for movie fights... End it could be a good way to spread word on the show"

6FGCpGNld0s,Worst Movie of Summer 2018?! MOVIE FIGHTS!,Lann Harris and Joe Star are so caught up in past movies that they can't appreciate what's in front of their face.
6FGCpGNld0s,Worst Movie of Summer 2018?! MOVIE FIGHTS!,I enjoyed both Solo and Fallen Kingdom. The house setting was my favorite part. I will be very surprised if Spencer doesn't get the point for this round.

6FGCpGNld0s,Worst Movie of Summer 2018?! MOVIE FIGHTS!,The Meg was bad. The characters were dull and I only enjoyed 2 characters. Why did Ruby Rose look like visual effects during the movie. I hated Jason Staham character i thought he was dull and cliche. I only enjoyed the little kid and that was it and the action scenes. I didnt care for the plot but at least the movie was somewhat self aware. Good action scenes are made from good lovable characters which you feel rewarded once you see everything built to the action which is always shown in MCU films. This movie relies on flashy but fun action scenes and cheap jokes. 6.9/10
6FGCpGNld0s,Worst Movie of Summer 2018?! MOVIE FIGHTS!,I like it when we have people who know about films. Spencer is a beast.

6FGCpGNld0s,Worst Movie of Summer 2018?! MOVIE FIGHTS!,"I think this needs to be said regarding SJ movie fights. As much as I love these guys and their chemistry, people don’t seem to like any other new fighters that much. You guys mention this is why you love it: chemistry and fun. But these guys have been together for years now, of course they would absolutely get along. New fighters breed new chemistry, new challenge. Movie Fights has always been about different, interesting people giving out their arguments as they clash. We all need a little heat sometimes. It’s massively unfair to call out new fighters as “not as good” because you would rather see Dan Murrell on the table sweeping every round every single episode."

6FGCpGNld0s,Worst Movie of Summer 2018?! MOVIE FIGHTS!,I have a really great point to make for us YouTubers who have posted movie trailers on our channels the point is that every single movie trailer has music what is there ever been a movie trailer that has no music in them do we YouTubers want video games that has no music to enjoy and get excited to hear and watch the thing I am talking about is the YouTubes copyright laws rule that rule should be taken down this is our yes movement so that we can appreciate the hard work for the movie community let’s spread this message to other YouTubers to make this happen

6FGCpGNld0s,Worst Movie of Summer 2018?! MOVIE FIGHTS!,Solo wasn’t bad. Just forgettable.
6FGCpGNld0s,Worst Movie of Summer 2018?! MOVIE FIGHTS!,I get not liking Solo but the worst movie of the summer? Come on. It's got decent performances and there actually is a good bit of adventure. The chemistry between Han and Chewbacca was actually pretty fun. You guys sometimes decide how good a film is by what other people say and the box office. Solo was the best Star Wars film to come out this year by far. Gotti and Jurassic Park were much worse.  No Slenderman or The First Purge? Come on.
6FGCpGNld0s,Worst Movie of Summer 2018?! MOVIE FIGHTS!,Lon’s opening argument about JWFK being focused on bioethics is actually exactly why this was my favorite Jurassic movie since the original. Felt like a return to form in focusing on a deeper issue that the dinosaurs personify.

6FGCpGNld0s,Worst Movie of Summer 2018?! MOVIE FIGHTS!,"I liked Solo. It was my favorite movie of the summer because I just really enjoyed myself watching it. A:IW was a better movie imo, but it had such a bleak ending that I found myself empty and wanting to know its conclusion, whereas Solo was a genuinely fun movie."
6FGCpGNld0s,Worst Movie of Summer 2018?! MOVIE FIGHTS!,Solo was better than TLJ. At least it was just bland and inoffensive. TLJ couldn’t even do that✌️
6FGCpGNld0s,Worst Movie of Summer 2018?! MOVIE FIGHTS!,Technically you could look into all of the character's computers if you break into the matrix computer so Lon wins for me.
6FGCpGNld0s,Worst Movie of Summer 2018?! MOVIE FIGHTS!,A movie that can make me have more emotional attachment to CGI dinosaurs than the main human characters can NOT be a bad movie. That's one hell of an achievement. That scene on the dock was heartbreaking and Blue is just too awesome not to root for. Solo was fine. If an okay movie equals bad for you then I can't help that.

6FGCpGNld0s,Worst Movie of Summer 2018?! MOVIE FIGHTS!,I'll be honest.  I didn't hate Solo.
6FGCpGNld0s,Worst Movie of Summer 2018?! MOVIE FIGHTS!,Give it to the Russo brothers. They turned Captain America into a badass spy movie with Winter Soldier. They could make a classic Bond movie with a modern flair.
6FGCpGNld0s,Worst Movie of Summer 2018?! MOVIE FIGHTS!,why are you all so loud
6FGCpGNld0s,Worst Movie of Summer 2018?! MOVIE FIGHTS!,The next time you do a fundraiser I think you should put a donor level that gives the donors who give that amount a shot at being on movie fights. Take the donors and do off camera eliminations so the winner gets on an episode. The elimination rounds would help ensure that you don’t get trolled by someone who knows nothing about movies.
6FGCpGNld0s,Worst Movie of Summer 2018?! MOVIE FIGHTS!,"I know you chose the movies so you could put their posters in the thumbnail as click bait and I respect the hustle, but there were FAR worse films that dropped this summer.  Show Dogs.  Skyscraper.  Happytime Murders."

6FGCpGNld0s,Worst Movie of Summer 2018?! MOVIE FIGHTS!,"With the question being ""Worst popular movie of summer 2018"" there could be made a case for Jurassic World 2 (also maybe Solo, though that is definitely not my opinion) but Spencer was right on with Gotti. Others had to be the god-awful Overboard, Life of the Party and Book Club. In all three I felt like comedy is dying right in front of my eyes."

6FGCpGNld0s,Worst Movie of Summer 2018?! MOVIE FIGHTS!,"Oh please.....The Last Jedi is a cinematic abomination. Solo was not as bad. Solo had some good cinematography and a great cameo. Also Jurassic World:Fallen Kingdom was NOT bad at all. I’m glad they went bad to the tense/horror elements of the first. What are you smoking?? My worst movie of the summer/year is The Meg. The shark wasn’t even as big as they showed in the commercials, There was so much unnecessary comedy and terrible acting."

Even on SJU he just seems to be the pretty guy who parrots the most negative and simple bits of conventional wisdom. Solo may not have been the best blockbuster of the season, but it was definitely one of the best times I've had at the movies this summer. ."

Not sure what the correct technical terms would be, but the current video quality makes watching the video for more than an hour a bit difficult. Thanks for the show nevertheless."
6FGCpGNld0s,Worst Movie of Summer 2018?! MOVIE FIGHTS!,"Solo was definitely not the worst movie of the summer of 2018, maybe the worst blockbuster, but by no means bad. Also not great but not bad."

6FGCpGNld0s,Worst Movie of Summer 2018?! MOVIE FIGHTS!,The opening and closing arguments have gotten way too long.  This episode is pushing the 90-minute mark!  Wasn't there time limits on these things?  It drags the show out and makes it boring.

6FGCpGNld0s,Worst Movie of Summer 2018?! MOVIE FIGHTS!,"1-Haven't seen many this summer(bad films) so probably Tag, the one that I disliked the most
2-Kathryn Bigelow especially after her films like Point Break, Detroit, Zero Dark Thirty and Hurt Locker. She can make it gritty and entertaining and really cinematic
3-Umbridge from Harry Potter just cause she is a bitch and she needed to get caught out
4-Falllout, fanfuckingtastic."
6FGCpGNld0s,Worst Movie of Summer 2018?! MOVIE FIGHTS!,Solo was just another movie it wasn't the worst movie of the summer
6FGCpGNld0s,Worst Movie of Summer 2018?! MOVIE FIGHTS!,"Solo was not that bad. it wasn't great it was just okay, but not bad."

6FGCpGNld0s,Worst Movie of Summer 2018?! MOVIE FIGHTS!,Danielle's expression when Dan's talking junk at the end is cracking me up
6FGCpGNld0s,Worst Movie of Summer 2018?! MOVIE FIGHTS!,Cucumber could bring the whole muppet show and Dan would still wipe the floor with him.
6FGCpGNld0s,Worst Movie of Summer 2018?! MOVIE FIGHTS!,"I'm so confused about Movie Fights next week. I thought (maybe foolishly, they just sound so similar) that Ed Greer was the voice of Cucumber...so how is that going to work...?"

6FGCpGNld0s,Worst Movie of Summer 2018?! MOVIE FIGHTS!,Lon is better fact checking. He constantly interrupts everyone and incoherently babbles as loud as he can as if his volume will win points. 😒
6FGCpGNld0s,Worst Movie of Summer 2018?! MOVIE FIGHTS!,Solo was decent. Fallen Kingdom was amazing.
6FGCpGNld0s,Worst Movie of Summer 2018?! MOVIE FIGHTS!,"Hello Hal,

What Owl themed character will you be for the Halloween special?"
6FGCpGNld0s,Worst Movie of Summer 2018?! MOVIE FIGHTS!,I hated Jurassic world fallen kingdom so much definitely the worst of this year!
6FGCpGNld0s,Worst Movie of Summer 2018?! MOVIE FIGHTS!,"Worst movie should always include the expectations for a film/genre.  Putting Gotti in there is punching down.  The only expectations for that movie were that it was going to suck--it did suck and so met the expectations of the viewers.  Now JW 2 Fallen Franchise the expectations are dinosaurs run amok on a large scale, man learns a lesson.  Only 1/2 the movie had the proper levels of amok, and the protagonists clearly didn't learn jack.  Penning the dinosaurs in a house...idiocy.  Oh and Solo gets a pass for letting the wookie wreck shop as a damn wookie should."
6FGCpGNld0s,Worst Movie of Summer 2018?! MOVIE FIGHTS!,Felt like dan was against joe
6FGCpGNld0s,Worst Movie of Summer 2018?! MOVIE FIGHTS!,"Sick ""Dino Riders"" reference, Spenny G."
6FGCpGNld0s,Worst Movie of Summer 2018?! MOVIE FIGHTS!,"I didn't see any of the movies argued as ""the worst"" in round one. I saw 2001: A Space Odyssey in 70mm instead. It was sublime."
6FGCpGNld0s,Worst Movie of Summer 2018?! MOVIE FIGHTS!,Lon is a literal fast talker. That comes in handy in Movie Fights.
6FGCpGNld0s,Worst Movie of Summer 2018?! MOVIE FIGHTS!,"I was hoping they would stick to it being Dan vs Cucumber for the title. Ed's just going to get in the way of the rivalry of the century. [And Ed'll probably end up winning it because, you know.... it's all predetermined :oP lol]"
6FGCpGNld0s,Worst Movie of Summer 2018?! MOVIE FIGHTS!,Steve McQueen should direct the next bond movie.
6FGCpGNld0s,Worst Movie of Summer 2018?! MOVIE FIGHTS!,"Lon I can't even, fallen kingdom was legendary, also Joe I agree star wars sucks. That brontasaurus was the first dinosaur to be shown in the franchise, so it's a significant scene in the movie."
6FGCpGNld0s,Worst Movie of Summer 2018?! MOVIE FIGHTS!,"So Solo is garbage because it doesn't offer anything new and didnt live up to the Star Wars name? I didn't think it was a ""great"" movie, but it wasnt garbage by a long shot. You have to judge movies off of themselves, their story telling, their direction, their acting. It's unfair to say that since it's not as good its therefore garbage"
6FGCpGNld0s,Worst Movie of Summer 2018?! MOVIE FIGHTS!,"So glad Lon got the win, he is a great guy."
6FGCpGNld0s,Worst Movie of Summer 2018?! MOVIE FIGHTS!,"As a hardcore JP fan, Fallen Kingdom was a huge disappointment."
6FGCpGNld0s,Worst Movie of Summer 2018?! MOVIE FIGHTS!,Lon is a national treasure
6FGCpGNld0s,Worst Movie of Summer 2018?! MOVIE FIGHTS!,I like how they picked 2 ok movie as the worst movie
6FGCpGNld0s,Worst Movie of Summer 2018?! MOVIE FIGHTS!,"How could anyone seriously think Jurassic World 2 was the worst movie of the summer? It obviously wasn't the best but come on, it's nowhere near the worst."

6FGCpGNld0s,Worst Movie of Summer 2018?! MOVIE FIGHTS!,A couple comments.  1) Can you knock off the 5 minute intro?  We get it.  Just a quick intro on the fighters is enough.  2) Can you put the time indexes for each specific round in the comments (I suppose with this you wouldn't need number 1).
6FGCpGNld0s,Worst Movie of Summer 2018?! MOVIE FIGHTS!,"No one mentioned Spielberg for Bond?  He created Indiana Jones to do a version of Bond, and he has been doing spy movies lately (Munich, Bridge of Spies)."
6FGCpGNld0s,Worst Movie of Summer 2018?! MOVIE FIGHTS!,I personally liked Solo. I think its WAAYYYYY better than The Last Jedi.

6FGCpGNld0s,Worst Movie of Summer 2018?! MOVIE FIGHTS!,One thing about the dude arguing falling kingdom. He claims that all the dinosaurs that were auctioned never went with their buyers as the buyers were eaten. You literally see one of the first dinos to be auctioned getting transported through a desert on a truck and it hinted towards more.
6FGCpGNld0s,Worst Movie of Summer 2018?! MOVIE FIGHTS!,"Because of all his silly answers, it seems like Joe doesn't even care about movie fights."

6FGCpGNld0s,Worst Movie of Summer 2018?! MOVIE FIGHTS!,"Both Jurassic World and Solo were complete trash.  The writing of both were not even close to professional.   Solo with Lando forgetting Solo owes him a ship and flies them around even though they don't know eachother, and trying to work with the people who just threw them in jail....the girl who blows herself up... so much writing fail.. Jurassic world there were no good thoughts or communications.  Everything is based on luck, and the interaction on catching blue barely resembles ?? Chris Pratt gets angry because they shoot it too early then the girl draws a gun and tells them not to kill her.  WTF?  they just happen to make it on the boat, no one sees.... they get captured by trying to get the trex blood themselves while blue is in the captures care.... only escape because of ramming dino next door..... uuugh.  the clone frees them because they're clones too..... uuugh.

6FGCpGNld0s,Worst Movie of Summer 2018?! MOVIE FIGHTS!,"I feel like I’m in the minority, but I think “Solo” is one of the farthest things from a Star Wars movie I’ve ever seen. I think they wrote one draft of the script in an hour and Lucasfilm was like “Yeah, that’s good enough.” It was made just because it could be made, not because it actually needed to be made (that is a fact). If you actually break this movie down instead of mindlessly watching another movie in space with lasers, it makes very very little sense.

Also, very good Movie Fight! I haven’t listened to one in a while, but I forgot how much I love these."

MOVIE FIGHTS!,"Ok, I’m going to preface this statement by saying I realize I’m complaining about something that is just supposed to be fun and silly and I do realize this and I’m not totally serious and I love Ed and everything, but why does he get to fight for the belt? Dan defeated him so he could and now Ed’s getting a free pass? Also, why did Spencer lose it without being able to defend it to begin with? I know it was for the WIF event but they essentially just gave it away. That doesn’t seem fair (although I’m sure sure Spencer doesn’t actually care). And again, Ed is great, but we all know we just want a one on o e match where Dan fights a puppet. That’s the whole reason Cucumber was even given a chance at the belt. We wanted to watch Dan argue with a puppet. Come on guy, at least make it Spencer and give him a chance at it again."

Crap dialogue, zero character growth, rehashing the previous movie (Indoraptor is diriviative of the I-Rex), moronic characters and motivations, and garbage premise for the second half. Jurassic Park in a haunted house? Give me a freaking break."

I mean there's a short period of hate for each since it's one of the ten commandments to always hate the new one but I think the fanbase accepts Rogue One and seems to be okay with Solo now. It only bombed because the fans were boycotting Kathleen Kennedy for her overuse of the girl power message. 

As for the saga films, I don't think the hate will last. Fans used to hate on Revenge of the Sith and now they accept people who say it's the best one. TLJ may always leave a little bad taste in the mouths of some fans but there's no way they're going to hate Episode 9 as much. Remember. People used to hate Return of the Jedi and now it's one of the most important parts of the saga."

""If you took the star Wars out of it"".. ok take the dinosaurs out of Jurassic Park and the Gangsters out of Gotti and see what you've got (a Lost/Downtown Abbey crossover and ""Autumn in New York"" respectively)...

VlaQXJCjcpI,Honest Trailers Commentary - The Conjuring,"I used to watch some of those ghost shows on tv (remember tv folks?). Anyway, I stopped as it became so depressing to watch all those poor clueless naive people buy an old (and cheap muahaha) home and then have some ghosts, demons or bad plumbing/wiring wipe out their income and rip their equity away. Not entertaining, so I stick to movie things that go bump in the basement or attic."

VlaQXJCjcpI,Honest Trailers Commentary - The Conjuring,"Say ""love you bye"" like Spencer did in this episode."
VlaQXJCjcpI,Honest Trailers Commentary - The Conjuring,I can't believe you made fun of the Elvis scene. It was supposed to be a break from all the horror elements to see the humanity behind all the crazy situations that was happening. You'd rather see kids die than to see kids happy?
VlaQXJCjcpI,Honest Trailers Commentary - The Conjuring,Meme review
VlaQXJCjcpI,Honest Trailers Commentary - The Conjuring,Dan and Joe's ghost hunting show is weirdly ASMR ...
VlaQXJCjcpI,Honest Trailers Commentary - The Conjuring,"I actually like Ghost Adventures and I think you guys do them a disservice by disregarding their findings over many years now of investigating haunted locales. I can see why many people discredit paranormal investigation shows and I can't really blame them, especially when it comes to Zac Bagans and the GAC. However it isn't fair to say that everything they do is staged or nonsense. Like their intro states ""Some people believe in ghosts, some don't"""
VlaQXJCjcpI,Honest Trailers Commentary - The Conjuring,"LOL, great show this week guys. I really want to see the rogue/buddy exorcist dramedy you guys pitched, you guys need to start you own studio for all these great ideas."
VlaQXJCjcpI,Honest Trailers Commentary - The Conjuring,Can these three please become ghost hunters
VlaQXJCjcpI,Honest Trailers Commentary - The Conjuring,They completely left out Not Me and I Didn't Do It.
VlaQXJCjcpI,Honest Trailers Commentary - The Conjuring,"They put Taylor swift but not Michael Jackson's smooth criminal, ""Annie are you ok?"""
VlaQXJCjcpI,Honest Trailers Commentary - The Conjuring,Am I the first one that prefers the second and thinks The Nun (character) was creepy as fuck?
VlaQXJCjcpI,Honest Trailers Commentary - The Conjuring,I wanna tie all the jokes together into one movie about them making a movie about rouge cop preacher called into clear a rental property of spooky stuff. The movie is  based on “true events” and they have to go to court to get it made.
VlaQXJCjcpI,Honest Trailers Commentary - The Conjuring,Unless i am mistaken the clocks they show are old timee and have no am/pm sooo maybe they stop at 3:07 pm 1st ghost hobbit dinner???  great stuff
VlaQXJCjcpI,Honest Trailers Commentary - The Conjuring,“ You only see the evil part of Catholicism.” As opposed to...
VlaQXJCjcpI,Honest Trailers Commentary - The Conjuring,"the Hunt for Red October was my first thought... that'd be pretty cool, actually"
VlaQXJCjcpI,Honest Trailers Commentary - The Conjuring,"I'm so glad you guys started doing the commentaries, they've become my favourite part of honest trailers. You guys are such a funny team 👌"

VlaQXJCjcpI,Honest Trailers Commentary - The Conjuring,You guys are so entertaining 😂
VlaQXJCjcpI,Honest Trailers Commentary - The Conjuring,"Best commentary, just for the hilarious diversion on Ghost hunting shows."
VlaQXJCjcpI,Honest Trailers Commentary - The Conjuring,"Yea I love horror movies even though they scare the bejesus out of me. I can’t really watch em alone but I love watching them with people. It’s weird, they really do stress me out but the thrill is such a fun experience; the whole relief after anticipation is so much fun. It’s like when I eat hot Cheetos, can’t have a full bag of em without needing 8 bottles of water but I think they’re great anyways; I love the taste and I will continue to consume them. I’m terrible at analogies."

VlaQXJCjcpI,Honest Trailers Commentary - The Conjuring,"For a moment there I thought next week's HT would be Supernatural, but then I realized there's no way you'd have time to watch that AND Doctor Who, so... I am sad again. Maybe I'll win the lottery and buy next year's HT for this show."
VlaQXJCjcpI,Honest Trailers Commentary - The Conjuring,"No ""Alan?"""
VlaQXJCjcpI,Honest Trailers Commentary - The Conjuring,Seems like a lot of these issues could have been solved by removing all the doors....
VlaQXJCjcpI,Honest Trailers Commentary - The Conjuring,"The best honest trailer in long long time. Thank you Dan, Spencer and Joe."
VlaQXJCjcpI,Honest Trailers Commentary - The Conjuring,"That had to have been one of Spencer's better segues. ""I hope when we die we return to an oblique nothingness; so let's talk about The Conjuring!"""
VlaQXJCjcpI,Honest Trailers Commentary - The Conjuring,16:16 what did Spencer say here?
VlaQXJCjcpI,Honest Trailers Commentary - The Conjuring,Instead of “scareballs” it should have been “boo balls.”
VlaQXJCjcpI,Honest Trailers Commentary - The Conjuring,I need a #PuppetDan for Movie Fights.
VlaQXJCjcpI,Honest Trailers Commentary - The Conjuring,New video idea: Weirdest Hollywood court cases/ debates. Like WB vs Warren family

VlaQXJCjcpI,Honest Trailers Commentary - The Conjuring,I like high Joe.
VlaQXJCjcpI,Honest Trailers Commentary - The Conjuring,Brilliant as usual. Love you guys :)
VlaQXJCjcpI,Honest Trailers Commentary - The Conjuring,"I like the Conjuring movies. I feel they are a throwback to suspenseful horror (which is the best kind imo). 

James Wan understands true horror as it's not about how many teens a psycho serial killer can kill, but more about what lies around the corner, or what's behind the stairwell. Not all the scares work, but it's hard to scare people now-a-days as we're used to seeing so much fucked up things online anyway. He understands the build-up of tension in scenes and that's something Hollywood was never that good at (at least not in Horror).

And I totally agree with Joe Starr, don't show the monster. Let us imagine it."
VlaQXJCjcpI,Honest Trailers Commentary - The Conjuring,So are you guys going Predator next week?
VlaQXJCjcpI,Honest Trailers Commentary - The Conjuring,"I actually did jump from that to this, Dan!"
VlaQXJCjcpI,Honest Trailers Commentary - The Conjuring,"On the note of anticipation porn, sounds like the movie can't win with Dan. They draw out the anticipation and have a jump scare, you're mad. They draw it out and don't have a scare to subvert your expectations, you're mad. So which do you want? Lol."
VlaQXJCjcpI,Honest Trailers Commentary - The Conjuring,Why can't I download this? I watch it while traveling in the bus.
VlaQXJCjcpI,Honest Trailers Commentary - The Conjuring,Love you guys and this addition to honest trailers. :)

yxohMmHFRUU,Which Franchise Would Be Most Improved By Adding Pennywise? - MOVIE FIGHTS DEBUT DEATH MATCH!!,"Alright,  the pennywise round was completely ridiculous, WTF is up with the dude trynna put Pennywise in Pokemon, dude chill  out , Pokemon is the last place where pennywise should go, that nish is outrageous and that should have never been a thought that entered the world, hell nah bro. 
To begin with,Pennywise is a being that was created by the maker of the macroverse in the amazing world Stephen King has created. He has been around since the beginning of time as well as his counter part, Maturin the turtle who one day had a stomach ache and threw up, and created the universe of Stephen King by doing so. 
So, having said that, Pennywise is not a clown, he is a celestial being which feeds on humans, who has no physical form and can take any shape he desires to intimidate, frighten and manipulate his victims.
I think the person who got the closest to getting right was the girl that tried throwing Pennywise into Harry Potter, that kinda would make sense,  since in Harry Potter they are many malignant being such as this on, dementors being a good example as dark, soul sucking creature. The reason why I can see pennywise being in Harry Potter is because not only could it be one of King's many worlds within worlds, but because magic and wizards appear often in his stories, a good example being the Dark Tower series. Also, a concept similar to Pennywise already exist in the Potter universe, this concept being the Boggart which is first found in professor Remus Lupin's class in Harry's third year in Hogwarts. A Boggart is an amortal  non-being which takes the form of his viewers worst fear, because of this no one knows it's true form. In my opinion, this creature is much like IT, and I can definitely see Pennywise being in the Harry Potter world, but definitely not in Pokemon or Suicide Squad."

They followed in the vein of the EU at the time. The movies barely scratched the surface of what is Star Wars and it's pretty stupid that people use the ""real Star Wars fan"" argument when you only know the movies."

The amount of apologists for that godawful movie is abysmal. I'd personally rather watch the shitty sequels (except Revenge of the Fallen) than the original because at least they have some form of merit amidst the piles and piles of shit. Dark of the Moon has an impressive wing suit sequence, Age of Extinction has the Dinobots (even if they came in way too late) and The Last Knight has Anthony Hopkins. The first film has boring and unfunny Sam Witwicky scenes that are borderline unwatchable mixed with stupid and boring scenes with Rachel Taylor's character and boring army scenes and it just sucks. Anybody who says ""oh, the first one was ALRIGHT"" are wrong and stupid and that's not just my opinion that's a fact."

yxohMmHFRUU,Which Franchise Would Be Most Improved By Adding Pennywise? - MOVIE FIGHTS DEBUT DEATH MATCH!!,"Round 4: mostly ignoring the arguments because I don't think anybody properly fought their point. Age of Extinction is by far the worst Transformers (haven't seen the new one, maybe its worse IDK). That said Phantom Menace is the clear winner and the reason is actually an argument that was made. In a Transformers movie you know exactly what you are going to get and you get it, if you don't like it it's your own fault for buying a ticket. Phantom Menace shits all over everything great about Star Wars. The light saber fight is not the best light saber fight, in fact I might call it the worst. It was nonsensical garbage and Darth Maul was not a bad ass. Maul was trying so hard to be badass and failed so spectacularly. No amount of fight choreography can cover the fact that the fight has no meaning, no weight, it's so pointless that they kill off 2 of the main characters in the film to attempt to force some meaning into it and they still failed. It doesn't hold a candle to literally any other fight in the series. It doesn't have remotely the emotional impact of Vader vs Luke in Jedi. Vader smacking down rebels at the end of Rogue One is a better light saber fight. Even Vader and Obi Wan's half ass fight in A New Hope is better."

He is thirsty and tired. He looks and sees a  well. Runs to it in hopes of getting a drink. He looks down and sees a bucket of water. He reaches down and it is just out of reach. Just as he is about to reach it a white gloved hand reaches out of the water and pulls him in. Pennywise takes him to his lair and bites his hand off. The boy screams. Just as he is about to bite the rest of the poor boys arm off he sees that the boys hand grows back. Pennywise looks at the boy in the face and says ""Why James what kind of special boy are you?"" Thats right the young boy is a young Wolvrine. Pennywise feasts on the ever healing James for days until his brother Sabertooth is able to track him down and save him. The movie then moves forward in time to the present day. The x-men get a report that young mutant children have been disappearing in maine.

What happened Movie Fights? There was a time when every round and every fighter was interesting.

Dan
Spencer
Nick 
Hal
Ellis
Mike
Roger
Trisha
Alicia
Napzok 

Those are the people we want to see guys, this time they were all nowhere to be seen. Love your show format, sadly todays fighters brought almost nothing to the table (except matt and ace as mentioned, they seem to fit the mindset this show requires, the transformer fight was pretty good).

I know that everyone of you do other things and dont always have time to do the show, and the different ideas applied to make the show more interesting by changing the format slightly like today are great, but at least one or two of the contenders we loved in the first year of the show should appear to make the show as great as it could be.
I dont mind new people, but when nine people completely new come around......there is a risk that several rounds fall completely flat.

Your fighter roster makes your show screen junkies, and i feel it is deep and rich (jeremy jahns and chris stuckmann and such are always welcomed guests).

Hope for a glory return to the golden days.

BRING IT ON DAN, TAKE ON SPENCER IN THE HEAVY WEIGHT FIGHT WE KNOW IT IS GONNA BE, CANT WAIT!!!!

Scorpion King was so bad it stopped being released to cinemas and went straight to DVD. Why was it even a thing, because of Dwayne Johnson? Studio made four of the train wrecks. Round 2: Star Trek, actually there's a precedent for it, in the original series episodes: Catspaw, and the children shall lead, wolf in the fold, and Miri all dealt in some form or fashion with psychic ghosts, children, and murder.
Round 3: Not the best of all time, but Daniel Craig in Star Wars the force awakens was easily the best recent one. It was unexpected, the movie didn't draw attention to it, and he did something that his famous character wouldn't do.

3. Dakota Johnson was the best thing in 50 shades. The dialogue and story is horrible trash...no actor saves that.
4. Twilight is not that bad. Sure it's YA romance crap but it is better than most ya like divergent series.

He explains that all Living Receivers, after their deaths in the primary universe , are chosen to become inter-dimensional travelers (lets just call them travelers) mending and preventing rips and disruptions in time as to prevent as many occurrences of tangent universes as possible. But, if travelers were to stop preventing tangent universe creations or do something wrong their abilities would be stripped away from them and be banished to any given dimension. Pennywise was one of these travelers who did something terrible and was banished to the universe It takes place in. But, recently it had been discovered that he had been eating children for decades of his dimensions time, so Donnie gets sent to handle it.

As a die hard for the games I hate what Paul W. S. Anderson has done to my franchise. I just the other day finally saw Resident Evil The Final Chapter and I am so glad that I didn't see it in theaters because I would have walked out in the first 15 minutes when they DON'T EVEN GET PARTS OF THEIR OWN FRANCHISE RIGHT! They destroy canon events that happened in the films, change parts of characters' history, contradict their own movies, and add in useless garbage to shoehorn in some thing that resembles an ""ending"". Where Alice and friends are all in a city that should be completely destroyed and Radioactive from the 5 Kiloton nuke that blew up 10 years before this ""movie"" takes place.
While we all know that all movies based off of video games suck. Paul W. S. Anderson made deliberate choices to contradict his own films and execute poor choices unbecoming of a director in Hollywood. Thus Resident evil sucks more than Twilight and Transformers.

yxohMmHFRUU,Which Franchise Would Be Most Improved By Adding Pennywise? - MOVIE FIGHTS DEBUT DEATH MATCH!!,"1)  Man of Steel-  I have only left the theatre angry after watching 3 movies in my life and two of them were in the DCEU franchise and Man of Steel was the first.  Zach Snyder has no concept of what Superman is or should be.  He took a the epitome of optimistic superhero characters and put him in muted, dark, and depressing story that set the tone for how DC Comics would be represented as for at least until Wonder Woman came out (there's even an argument to be made that that movie was too dark.)  It takes Jonathan Kent who is supposed to be the guiding light of morality for Superman, and Snyder makes him give the argument that heroes should let children drown if the outcome may be inconvenient.  Also, Superman who is supposed to stand for hope, not to mention truth and justice, is a murderer who causes the destruction of several 9/11s due to ineptitude.  This is a terrible movie, a terrible depiction of Superman, and it poisoned the well for the DCEU.

2)  Home Alone-  The first two movies are some of the best kids films ever made and then the franchise got progressively worse with each made for tv/direct to dvd addition.  So, let's have Pennywise, an entity that feeds off the fear of children, and have him face off against a kid that overcomes his fears and fights it off with deathtrap after deathtrap.  

3)  Neil Patrick Harris, Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle-  NPH shows up out of nowhere in this film without a hint of foreshadowing and it's the most memorable part of the film.  NPH plays a hilarious version of ""himself"" that shows off his acting range because this version couldn't be further from the real man.  It's the most memorable part of the film, and it was not only the beginning of a franchise for him, but the comeback that his career needed.  Without this cameo, there would be know Barney Stinson.

4)  Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides-  Full disclosure, I love the first 3 Pirates movies.  But, ""On Stranger Tides"" is terrible.  All of the new characters fell flat, there is far too much Jack Sparrow, and the plot is nonsensical and easily forgotten.  The movie is so bad that none of the new characters or any of the plot of this film is mentioned again in the next film of the franchise.  (My answer would totally have been Transformers: Dark of the Moon if it wasn't already taken.)

5)  Bonnie Wright and Daniel Radcliffe, The Harry Potter films-   The romance between Harry Potter and Ginny Weasley may have been different in the books, but these two had no reason to be together in the films, but more so, the actors looked bored together.

6)  Jack Black-  There's nothing about Jack Black's personality or career that says dark.  You wouldn't be able to take him seriously as the suave Bruce Wayne and certainly couldn't take him seriously as the Batman.  Can you imagine Jack Black in an anatomically correct rubber suit?

7)  Julie Walters as Mrs. Molly Weasley, The Harry Potter series-  She cares deeply for and protects not only her own 7 children but is like a second mother to Harry Potter.  Her children love her and she lives to take care of her family.  And when Bellatrix and the Death Eaters threaten her children, she kills Bellatrix to protect them.  You don't get much better than that.

8)  Ace Ventura-  After Son of the Mask, I don't think you can save that franchise even if Jim Carrey was to return to the role of Stanley Ipkiss.

9)  South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut-  It gave you everything that you could love from South Park and made brought it to the cinematic level.  It works just as much as a satirical comedy about censorship and bigotry as it does as a send up of movie musicals.  It was even nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Song.  Without South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut there would not be a Book of Mormon."

yxohMmHFRUU,Which Franchise Would Be Most Improved By Adding Pennywise? - MOVIE FIGHTS DEBUT DEATH MATCH!!,"I'm kinda disappointed in Round 2. I like the idea of adding Pennywise to Pokemon and Suicide Squad, but they didn't really explain it properly.
In Pokemon, Pennywise can be added as a legendary pokemon in a new season. There are some pokemon Gods in the franchise like Archeus, Giratina, etc. So an alien creature that can shapeshift imo isn't a bad idea at all as a pokemon. And Pokemon isn't always bright and cute, it has some dark moments too. You probably only watched some episodes of the series if you think that way.
In Suicide Squad, the problem is, she add Pennywise as Joker's brother. Are you serious? Joker is a human, and Pennywise isn't. I haven't watched IT and I know that. What could be a good idea is adding Pennywise into Suicide Squad without changing it's background story. I mean, it's background is already look like a super-villain. And that's what Suicide Squad is, a group of super-villain."
