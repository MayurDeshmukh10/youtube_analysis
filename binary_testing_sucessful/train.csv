The gradual bond between Joel & Ellie that happened in the first game will be completely missing from this game & it‚Äôs obviously a game of revenge. I will play it but may not on day one.,1

w4Jx_OOhouA,"BIG Xbox Reveals! New Xbox Studio, Project Xcloud, PS5 Leak, Xbox games, Inside Xbox, Last of US 2",I disagree about making a single player only games.. I keep hearing people say consumers should have the option but making a game single player only is not giving a consumer an option on how to experience the game.. people should stop trying to cater to one side or the other.. instead start asking developers make these immersive worlds and that get players attached to the characters while making a game where players can choose how they want to experience the story in either solo or co-op.. that's why I enjoyed the Gears franchise so much because if I decide I want to play the story by myself I can or if I want to play with my friend I can it's an option.. and this is coming from someone that really enjoyed Assassin's Creed Odyssey but just imagine if you could play that game in co-op experiencing the whole story with a friend how fun that would be.,1

No Batman announcement ruined the day for me! I got duped into believing a ‚Äúleaker‚Äù that Batman would be at the Sony event.

U5FwpkMA-HM,TRAPPED in a HAUNTED HOUSE with my GIRLFRIEND!! (Scary Game),"It's is better to play 4 player. Also when you play this game their 2 types of dolls cursed and regular.
 The regular one helps tame the lady if she flys at you.
You need to have one person with a cursed doll and one with a regular ones. Also you need to go down to the furnace in the basement to burn the cursed dolls. 
I think u need to burn 8.
Also to light the furnace you need wood and matches.
It takes awhile to burn and put another one in.
The cursed ones are black and white.
The regular ones looks like a ordinary doll.
Hope you read this comment sorry so long been watching you since zombs mod 3.

BR_k9gaCVkw	TRIVIA MURDER PARTY LIVE (Game Bang)	could you guys maybe try not to all talk at the same time.   It is talk, talk, talk and it is very hard for me to keep up now with that many people of what is being said, and can also get a little obnoxious.   Could the editing be where there is a space between when people talk?  It would also be nice if that it is not so fast with the camera changes to the people so quick where I  can't even have a chance to read the questions and also the answers.  Focus on question on game first and then let us see some of your guys banter.  Overall I really did like this though and would love to see this played again as a gamebang or something. I just would like the videos to be of a better quality and not have to keep going back to see a part, I barely missed.	1

LMDA-zEEQUM	Honest Trailers Commentary - The Oscars (2019)	Paddington 2 was the biggest snub don't @ me		
LMDA-zEEQUM	Honest Trailers Commentary - The Oscars (2019)	Honestly, the issue of Black Panther's nomination is that BP did absolutely nothing new. There was no clever, innovative structure or unique villain or any difficult goal the movie succeeded in accomplishing. It was simply a fun, flawed comic book movie; just like 80% of the MCU. BP's nomination is so controversial to me because it was a middle-of-the-road, entertaining movie that somehow is nominated for Best Picture over Infinity War, which whether you enjoyed IW or not was much more ambitious, much more clever, and handled a much more difficult concept, all the while juggling a gargantuan cast and 20 different character arcs and still managed to deliver a cohesive final product. BP is on the ticket for the exact same reason BlacKKKlansman and Vice are on, and that is so a bunch of rich white Hollywood elites feel good about their social impact by elevating decent films solely based on the topic being discussed instead of the execution of the topic. That is the issue with BP's nomination; the nomination isn't for the quality of the movie but rather for self-serving social commentary.

LMDA-zEEQUM	Honest Trailers Commentary - The Oscars (2019)	See the funny thing here is Blackkklansman is the movie I would be almost the most annoyed if won. Vice and Rhapsody are such nothing movies, but Blackkklansman is just a movie that the world DOES NOT NEED right now. If there is any organization that didn't need to add fictional events to make them seem more evil it is the KKK and the left exaggarating about how the right is is kind of how we ended in this fucking mess we are in. There are few things I hate more than movies having their primary theme centered around ''THIS MOVIE WAS IMPORTANT!''. Vice did that too, and did it worse so that is the one I would be most pissed about but Blackkklansman is a close second. We know the KKK is evil, you don't have to add in fictional bombs to make them seem that way.		
LMDA-zEEQUM	Honest Trailers Commentary - The Oscars (2019)	SPY-MAN		
LMDA-zEEQUM	Honest Trailers Commentary - The Oscars (2019)	I agree with Dan's point on comic book movies under one condition, if all next comic book movies are set in a non white community

LMDA-zEEQUM	Honest Trailers Commentary - The Oscars (2019)	Bohemian Rhapsody is the worst movie to get a nomination I think I know of. It has good songs!! Thats it.		
LMDA-zEEQUM	Honest Trailers Commentary - The Oscars (2019)	Once I heard Bohemian Rhapsody was going to sideline his sexuality I decided I wasn't going to see it unless it was really standout, and it wasn't. A Queen biopic would've been a great chance to do actually address AIDS from a different perspective and not just make a cool music video movie skirting around a serious issue that reverberates to this day.		
LMDA-zEEQUM	Honest Trailers Commentary - The Oscars (2019)	Last year, the first sci do movie won best picture (the shape of water), if black panther wins this year, the academy might finally be acknowledging more types of movies (black panther is not only a comic book movie, but Blockbusters barely ever win, too)		
LMDA-zEEQUM	Honest Trailers Commentary - The Oscars (2019)	I'm gonna say it: Infinity War was better. Black Panther was better than the rest of the best picture nominees though. Don't @ me.		
LMDA-zEEQUM	Honest Trailers Commentary - The Oscars (2019)	can we get a sorry to bother you trailer		
LMDA-zEEQUM	Honest Trailers Commentary - The Oscars (2019)	Eh let‚Äôs be honest, the fact the BP is a comic book movie has nothing to do with the nomination. It was a movie with an almost entirely black cast that made a lot of money. That‚Äôs the only reason it got Oscar approval.		
LMDA-zEEQUM	Honest Trailers Commentary - The Oscars (2019)	The only thing that bothers me about how inaccurate Bohemian Rhapsody is is that they say he‚Äôs just gay, but he was clearly bisexual and even dated another woman after Mary for a long time. So now, a lot of people will likely think Freddie was gay and not bi and we‚Äôll lose a bit of his history		
LMDA-zEEQUM	Honest Trailers Commentary - The Oscars (2019)	Please film a wandering earth review, more people need to know about this crazy movie		
LMDA-zEEQUM	Honest Trailers Commentary - The Oscars (2019)	I don't really agree with Dan's point - The inaccuracies in Man on the Moon is part of the joke of that film: Jim Carrey in character as Andy Kaufman even states at the beginning of the film that events in his life get mixed around in the movie and that he hates it and then he tells everyone to leave the theatre, which works for the film knowing what we know about Kaufman. The inaccuracies in Bohemian Rhapsody are just sad and emotionally manipulative in order for a ""big pay off"" to the Live Aid performance. It's not in anyway the same because tonally both films are so different but I do agree with Dan that there were at least fifty films released last year that should have been nominated for Best Picture in its place - in fact most films released last year were probably more worthy of this nomination.		
LMDA-zEEQUM	Honest Trailers Commentary - The Oscars (2019)	My black panther and bohemian rant, is if either of them win, then that instance should have gone to Mad Max over Spotlight. That was such a no brainer it hurts.		
LMDA-zEEQUM	Honest Trailers Commentary - The Oscars (2019)	Why didn't the Winter Soldier get nominated for best picture years ago?! I'm still salty about that.		
LMDA-zEEQUM	Honest Trailers Commentary - The Oscars (2019)	""3:13 I'm pretty sure Taran from Linus Tech Tips did this at LTX last year.

LMDA-zEEQUM,Honest Trailers Commentary - The Oscars (2019),"I think the Bohemian rhapsody was a great musical. I watched it without any cinematographic expectations, but the great music just balanced out everything else. Does it deserve an Oscar? Well, compared to say Moonlight - sure it does. You have to understand Oscars are political, the last 5 years the awards (and some of the nominations) has simply baffled me, so I honestly don't expect anything good from this years's ceremony. I like the Black Panther, I think it's a good, stand-alone movie and sure I don't mind if it gets an Oscar. And I don't care if the movie is going to get an awards because the cast is black, or if the whole controversy actually started because the case is black. It's a good movie. Is it better than Deadpool 1? No. But it's ok. And you know, I'm glad Marvel doesn't get awards. Because it simply wouldn't be fair. If you ask me what is the best movie of 2018, I'd say from what I watched ""A star is born"" is the best.",1
LMDA-zEEQUM,Honest Trailers Commentary - The Oscars (2019),"I did find Bohemian Rhapsody enjoyable, but my first reaction walking out of the theater, was that the movie was a bit depressing. Considering how wild a life he led, the movie is depressing.  and that is part of my second point, I was disappointed when I found out how inaccurate the movie was. I usually stay away from biopics for how notoriously unreliable they are, but Freddie Mercury had a crazy life, and they should have been able to make a movie about his life without lying. He took princess Diana to a gay club in ""drag"" and I was hoping to see where they got approached to do the soundtrack for Flash Gordon. I suppose you're right about the other band members not allowing it, so I suppose we'll have to wait another twenty years, then we'll get the accurate Freddie Mercury Movie.

LMDA-zEEQUM,Honest Trailers Commentary - The Oscars (2019),"I think Blackkklansman was the best movie last year for me. At least one of the top 2 or 3 for sure. And I haven't seen, most of the best picture nominees or a ton of others so take that for what it is. But as far as the ending of the movie, for me the movie ended and then we got a message from the director. Like a hey dipshit, this isn't a thing of the past. It's still a problem now. And so I almost don't count that as part of the movie but that's just how I took it and when it's something as important as this subject matter I'm okay with a 5 minute editorial/message at the end. Now if a movie ends and then we get a ""Now here's why the earth is flat and everyone is lying to you"" I'd have an issue with it.",1

LMDA-zEEQUM,Honest Trailers Commentary - The Oscars (2019),i guess it's because i'm short on time but i find myself just watching this and not the actual honest trailer it's lovely because I get both,1
LMDA-zEEQUM,Honest Trailers Commentary - The Oscars (2019),Black Panther is overrated. If it wins it‚Äôs pandering to the utmost degree. Just cause we are want a good comic book movie to get nominated doesn‚Äôt mean we want to be pandered to. Y‚Äôall looking at this so black and white. Oddly enough the world doesn‚Äôt work like that.,1
LMDA-zEEQUM,Honest Trailers Commentary - The Oscars (2019),"Black Panther is a good movie, but a lot of people feel that there's been better comic book movies that weren't nominated, so it's a legitimate question for them to ask, ""Why is THIS one the first?"" Whatever you think the answer to that question is, fine. But if someone postulates that PERHAPS the fact that there was so much attention paid by pop culture to the fact that it's the ""first black superhero movie"" (even though it isn't...), and that therefore the Academy (well known for having liberal leanings and often giving particular attention to movies that lean that way, sometimes even if they're not particularly good, like Crash) singling it out to nominate might have something to do with race relations more than it does with filmmaking... it doesn't mean they're racist and just hate Black Panther because they hate black people. It means that they're recognizing a pretty likely reality. 


But this is a way that people try to shut down the criticism without actually addressing any of the real arguments against the movie. They just ASSUME why you don't like the movie because they've convinced themselves there's only one reason that anybody could ever have for not liking the movie. 



I mostly do like the movie. It's well-made, the acting is good, there's some good action in it, the story is decent, and SOME interesting ideas are brought up. Kilmonger is an interesting villain, and his death scene is beautiful. 
Wakanda is a cool place that's well realized. Shuri is a really likeable character.
But I recognize there are plenty of problems with the movie too. T'Challa is a rather bland protagonist. I don't know quite what it is, but the spark that he had in Civil War just isn't there here. It may be Boseman's performance, which seems strangely reserved, even at times when perhaps he ought to be a bit more passionate to actually be a compelling lead. He had more passion and emotion in Civil War.


I don't like that Martin Freeman's character is such a rosey, friendly, heroic image of the CIA in Africa, when the real history of the CIA in Africa (as well as the rest of the world) would have them be the villains of this movie. It's clear that he's meant to be the ""token white guy"" (or ""Tolkien white guy"" along with Andy Serkis) who serves as the sounding board for flippant colonization references, yet is still this wholesome helpful guy who's instrumental in saving the day! This is an example of something that could have been interesting and really had a message to it, but it feels so shallow and manipulative. If they had actually allowed for some bold storytelling, they would have given Freeman some more nuance, and had his character end up being a third-party conflict. Maybe he's actually on a secret CIA mission to gather intel about vibranium because the US government is seeking to pillage it. That would be a more interesting and realistic use of a CIA agent in the story. It would also add another dimension to the decision to give vibranium to the world at the end. That's the kind of storytelling decision I'd say would make it more Oscar-worthy, if they pulled it off well.


And uh... get rid of the f**king CGI rhinos.
The climax of the movie feels too conventional for a story that had felt more unique and interesting when it hinged on ideological differences. But there's no resolution on that front, other than to kill the guys we disagree with who want to do ""bad things"". Part of what made Kilmonger interesting is that he has SOME credibility when it comes to his concerns about oppressed black people worldwide. The ending of the movie with T'Challa opening Wakanda to the world, starting the schools/charity, etc... is cool and all, but it's an afterthought instead of being the resolution. Kilmonger dying is the way things are really resolved. Wouldn't it have been great if T'Challa had actually just told Kilmonger, ""Hey, how about we do this to help our oppressed brothers and sisters instead of blowing shit up?"". Kilmonger then has to justify why he wants to take the violent route, and then if they come to blows over it, it becomes an exploration of the nature of violence and whether it's the right answer. This is somewhat brought up, but not really explored. Exploring that in the scene, between the characters, is when it really matters. But instead they fight, Kilmonger dies, they blow up the ships, bad guys die and it's the easy way out. The theme is somewhat abandoned during the climax, and then only comes back into play for the denouement as a sort of ""button"" to the story instead of the climax. The pros and cons of violent means to supposedly righteous ends are never really weighed in any real way. Violence ends up being used to solve the problem of the threat of violence... what's the message there in the end, if there even is one? That's not great screenwriting... it's better than average, because at least it brought up these themes at all, but to be a great screenplay, you have to really delve into it and explore it more powerfully and integrally. The mark of a great comic book movie, IMO, is that it transcends being a comic book movie. The climax of this movie feels right dang smack in the middle of being a typical Hollywood comic book movie. Compare it to The Dark Knight, where our hero ends up in a stalemate with the villain and the climactic scene is literally them just talking about the nature of Gotham's society and pontificating about how their ideological differences have destined them to do this forever (shot in a really unique way, clearly visualizing the opposite ""ying and yang"" dynamic between them as the Joker is literally upside down and we twist to match his perspective opposite Batman's upright, ""normal"" perspective), before we get to the unconventional fourth act ending between our heroes and a fallen hero that involves a tough dilemma of covering up the fallen hero's crimes for the sake of the greater good, cutting to black with our hero on the run from the law, yet being glorified for doing so. That's an interesting climax and resolution. That's the type of movie I'd say is worthy of a Best Picture nomination, if not at least a Best Screenplay nom. It's actually challenging in terms of whether it's the right thing for the hero to do, and it really leans into that gray area. It forces the audience to ask themselves value questions that the film doesn't necessarily give an easy answer to. Black Panther tries to give easy answers and make the ending feel unquestionably positive.  Kilmonger dying is a sad scene, but once he's gone, things are all peachy, and T'Challa just up and decides to change Wakanda's ways because... it's time, i guess There's no weight given to the complicated concerns of what ""opening Wakanda to the world"" will actually entail and what the effects might be, for both Wakanda and the world. That's not really an exploration. It just kinda happens, and the real reason we're meant to like it is because ""Ooh, that means Wakanda tech will be in other movies now! Coolzies!"" Meanwhile, we get a nice little subtle message of ""Globalization = Good!"" and/or ""Using small sovereign nations for their resources = Good!"" 
Sounds like an American classic, I guess.


None of these are fatal flaws necessarily, and like I said, I do still think it's an overall good movie. But I don't think it's a great movie on the level of The Dark Knight, and there are better contenders just this year when it comes to comic book movies that deserve recognition. Infinity War had a way tougher job to do than Black Panther did, and it succeeded more flawlessly, IMO. It actually did do something unconventional with its story, and took more bold risks in how it dealt with its themes. The events that actually happened in it are what have made a cultural impact (not to mention an impact on the series' story), instead of its impact being mostly based on (you have to admit it)... the cast's race. The ""Snappening"" has had way more impact than anything from Black Panther, including ""Wakana Forever!"", which even Chadwick Boseman got sick of... and Michael B Jordon wanted nothing to do with.


So at the end of the day, it really does feel like the logical answer to ""Why is THIS one the first?"" is that it happened to be a successful film starring a black cast, that at least brings up some black issues, and the Academy felt that deserved to be recognized above films that actually had more bold, unique and resonating storytelling. And that would be fine, if it wasn't treated like this wasn't the case, and if the defenders of the movie didn't feel the need to make it seem like even suggesting that it might be the case makes you racist. It's not racist to recognize what the major element of the movie is that people seem to like or be paying attention to. If people JUST liked it because it's a good comic book movie, or because they think the story was well told, then the defense of the movie would be focused on that. But that's never the defense that's used. I only ever see it defended on the basis of it being ""groundbreaking"" for black representation, and that's why it's significant. That's true, and that's great in and of itself... but that doesn't necessarily make it a good movie. If you want to argue that ""Best Picture"" also entails the movie's place in history and how significant is in terms of things like minority representation... then fine, make that argument. But don't dismiss the people who care more about the quality of the movie itself as a movie and had legitimate problems on that front... either as racists or ""whiners"" just to make yourself feel righteous and mature. That's really not fair.",1

UcbFg__aMvA,Honest Trailer Commentaries - The Mummy (2017),"You CAN NOT mummify someone alive. Yes, there are instances of it happening naturally under special environmental circumstances, but that clearly wasn't the case here. The idea is quite silly - in order to stop the natural decomposition of the body, all the organs were removed and the body soaked in natron for a long ass time before ever being wrapped up. I will however applaud the movie for better showing the wrapping pattern of the linnen overlays, than the previous ones.. 

The chance of Tom Cruise's character ever running into anything of value (to a robber) in the Middle East is also extremely slim. I am unsure why that ever was considered a lucrative business to anyone. The amount of royal tombs found in the region are scarce, usually older and much more minimalistic than wealthy Egyptian royal tombs from the New Kingdom, which is what most people by now associate this line of movies with. Archaeology these days have very little to do with finding riches, movie makers. Not to mention the whole misconception regarding Set, but I see other people have gotten into explaining that, good on you btw.

Then when I saw the trailer, I really knew it was going to beyond suck. The Mummy is horror, not a bunch of running, so called action, terrible acting or spin off's for other supposed horror movies that are trying to be like all of the Marvel etc., universe movies. Movies today refuse to capture the essence of or be like how movies used to be, instead it's all about spending hundreds of millions of dollars on overpaid actors that only care about making money, terrible, stupid and pointless effects, awful stories/scripts, advertising that's incomplete or better than the actual movie and refusing to take the time to actually make something entertaining. The Mummy with Brendan Fraser had its flaws, but it's still enjoyable and infinity times better than this new piece of cinematic crap. The 1932 Karloff, the 1959 Christopher Lee and the Brendan Fraser Mummy movies are the best.",1

That being said, I am not a Tom Cruise fan, so I was prepared to hate this movie, but I thoroughly enjoyed it, but less because of the actual story and more because of its potential.

UcbFg__aMvA,Honest Trailer Commentaries - The Mummy (2017),"Hi, Screen Junkies. I love work you doing, i have fun watching your videos. And, Andy, i liked this movie. I saw it during fantasy and sci-fi ""Festival Fantazie"" (small con) here in Czech Republic for ca. one quarter of regular price for ticket, so this was one plus. I knew it was a bad movie, so i had no expectations. And i saw it after Great Wall, that helped too.
I love Tom Cruise. I like Russel Crow. And Sofia Boutella is hot as f***. I loved ""PG-13 bandages"" and ""tatooos from devil"". I knew about heavy exposition beforehand, so it did¬¥nt bother me that much. And i may have weird sense of humor, but i laughed a lot. (Funniest scene for me was when Cruise was under mummy at that altair and that stupid Dr. frozed in doors and Cruise called her name and she was like ¬¥What?¬¥and he ¬¥Run!¬¥ Well and that Book of the Dead cameo.)
Overall i know it¬¥s bad movie. But i don¬¥t find it unenjoyable. That Damsel in distress was annoying, but movie itself did not drag for me and festival¬¥s atmosphere in cinema was great. It¬¥s something else when it¬¥s full of fantasy/sci-fi geeks. :) So, yeah, i get where is Andy and others coming from, but i am not movie critic and i have lots and lots guilty pleasure movies. This will be one of them. Hell, my best friend unlike me loooooooves Transformers, Gods of Egypt and Pirates, so my taste is not that bad. :)",1

UcbFg__aMvA,Honest Trailer Commentaries - The Mummy (2017),"I appreciate that this view will be unpopular, but I actually didn't think it was that bad.

Since you asked for 'why' some people enjoyed it, here we go. Bear in mind that the films I love are ones like Arrival and Usual Suspects and I'm not a complete moron :D

Yes, it failed spectacularly at setting up a wider universe, and every mention of something that wasn't actually beneficial to the plot (e.g. Mr Hyde) felt forced, but it wasn't as bad as Batman V Superman or Amazing Spider-Man 2. Yes, it was incredibly generic; generic bad guy with generic powers and generic action hero with generic stunts and generic locations. None of the acting was phenomenally outstanding nor was it particularly awful.

It wasn't as cheesy as the original Mummy films, nor as funny, but it wasn't supposed to be.

They wanted to bring Jekyll and Mummy and Frankenstein and Dracula together and wanted them to be in that 'generic action film' bubble. So they brought in Tom Cruise, Mr Generic Action Hero himself. Have you watched the last few Mission Impossible films? Have you watched Knight And Day? Have you watched Jack Reacher 1 & 2? They're the same stunts, the same look and feel, the same acting, basically the same CHARACTER, but they're all enjoyable action films. This was a ""Tom Cruise film with a Mummy twist"" not a remake of the Mummy. 'Tom Cruise runs a lot, preferably away from explosions' is the mission statement.

So I found it vaguely enjoyable - mission impossible but with ancient Egyptian mythology vaguely draped across the top of it, with some big set pieces and some good female Mummy bad guy thing going on.

Did I think it was spectacular? No. But it's a bit harsh to attack it THIS much for being an average bland action film. Did it make me want to watch the rest of the universe? No. But that was never going to happen. Did I think it was a great Mummy remake? No. But it wasn't supposed to be. Did I think it was a pretty generic Tom Cruise film that had supernatural stuff over the top of it that didn't really make sense but then none of his films do and at least this was more interesting? Yeah a bit. I'm not even sure a 'good' Mummy film is really feasible - it has to be camp and cheesy and we're not really in that place in modern cinema anymore.

But yeah stop making shitty universes with generic films. This was better than Transformers 5 or Amazing Spider-Man 2 or BvS or F8Furious - but this is a mid range film with no real expectations compared to those juggernauts so I just don't understand the sheer volume of hate you guys have for this film... it was just a dumb action film, pitched a little too dark and generic to actually work, end of discussion lol",1

UcbFg__aMvA,Honest Trailer Commentaries - The Mummy (2017),"To answer your question, I liked the film mostly because of the Mummy herself. She's a very cool bad guy. I also liked a lot of the comedy and I liked how they tried to twist around some of the concepts, like Dr. Jekyll needs to take his drug to stay Jekyll. As for the DARK UNIVERSE! I just hope they don't scrap this one and then try to reboot it again. Like they've tried this DARK UNIVERSE idea like 4 times now and they can't just restart it over and over again and act like we can't remember all the other times they tried it.

UcbFg__aMvA,Honest Trailer Commentaries - The Mummy (2017),"The Mummy wasn't great, but as I watched the movie texting majority of the time I found the action scenes to be fun and liked Russell Crowe's over the top zaniness. The best way I can describe The Mummy is that it is a perfect movie to watch while editing or doing something else to distract you long enough for a short break, but then mediocre enough to resume your project. After watching the Honest Commentaries for both Kong Skull Island and The Mummy I have to say I have the opposite opinions on these movies. You guys make great points, but at the end of the day I guess it just comes down to personal preference when looking at extremely average studio mandated films.",1
UcbFg__aMvA,Honest Trailer Commentaries - The Mummy (2017),"I will say that, as an armature writer, I was ok with this movie. I don't remember anything from when I watched it so my brain probably shut off during it, but I remember leaving the theater with a feeling of ""this is ok"". I probably will never see it again but I'm optimistic about the dark universe, mainly for the fact that one of my favorite movies is the creature from the black lagoon.",1

Yes, Set was not a good guy, but Anubis was the god of the dead. Yet, the movie made a point of telling you he was, indeed, the god of death.

UcbFg__aMvA,Honest Trailer Commentaries - The Mummy (2017),"The actual action pieces in the film are good. Both Cruise and Boutella are good in key action moments but everything else in between was awful.

Here's me foolishly thinking the person playing the title character would have good screen time! Both her and Cruise could have done so much more I feel, yet the script was so weighted down by world building it just went nowhere. That being said, it has put me off going to see her in future roles or indeed Cruise once he's back in solid action films.",1

UcbFg__aMvA,Honest Trailer Commentaries - The Mummy (2017),"I loved watching the Mummy (1999) when was a kid, and I think it has aged really well.

Why is it so hard  for movie executives/producers to understand that it's better to put your best effort into one movie, that the audience will feel for and then (maybe) after a while give them a second adventure?

I fully recognize a ton of eww moments and there really is a flaw in the plot, but I think we just turned our brain off and it was fine to the point of we enjoyed it. Even now I feel as if I didn't waste my time watching it and am left with a ""It's really not that bad"" feeling.

Something along the lines of what I just said would be a better movie than what they put there if done correctly, even tho it sounds kinda unoriginal and overdone.

Why not just have the bot just present the entire dictionary and the human writers pick whatever words on that list in whatever order they like for the purpose of the project? That's writing. Humans wrote this. The robot named words then people changed them out. If the first draft was edited by a robot, ok.

So apparently the September 11th attacks happened in the MCU. I think its safe to say the MCU is a universe nearly identical to ours up until the events of Iron Man. After that, as they pointed out, the events of the movies become major world and universe events, and things like pop culture and politics change as a result. Obama and Fortnite apparently still are part of the MCU though, even if according to Iron Man 3, Obama never became president.

Instead we get Garbage & TLC because female vocalists and an instruction that this is Carol‚Äôs internal jukebox now she‚Äôs back on Earth. Its painful by the end because the music selected just hits the same beats again & again. The film‚Äôs track-list is classic 90s, but even on paper its a crap dj set, as the songs selected serve the construction of our protagonist‚Äôs psychology instead of telling a powerful story, which what a good music set will help you do.

FO8XZ4uBQKk,Honest Trailers Commentary | MCU,"Disney took over MCU distribution before Avengers 1. Contractually Paramount's logo appeared on Avengers and Iron Man 3, but Disney distributed both of those. 



But Marvel Studios is still the production house. Paramount (and Universal for Incredible Hulk) just had a distribution deal, so the creative continuity was unbroken from the outset. The difference between distributor and creator can best by seen now by the Spider-Man movies, which Marvel makes so it fits in the continuity, but Sony distributes it to theaters and home video per its ownership rights.


Disney later acquired Distribution rights back to Iron Man, Iron Man 2, Thor and Captain America FA, for home media distribution. Universal still controls Incredible Hulk home video rights but Disney can use it for boxed sets and such.",1
FO8XZ4uBQKk,Honest Trailers Commentary | MCU,"8:13 I'll be ""that guy"" in a couple ways.  First, I'm commenting before the video ends, and second, I know there's a huge difference between the Norse Pantheon of the Prose Edda and Poetic Edda (of historical verbal legend and the contribution Snorri Sturluson) and Jack Kirby and Stan Lee's comic book characters, but here we go.

Odin has several children, so Thor has many siblings. Hela (or Hel) is not one of them, nor is Loki for that matter.  Loki is actually Odin's blood brother in that they both cut their wrists and shmushed their gross wounds together (I guess the Aesir and Juten don't fear God-AIDS), thus making Loki Thor's uncle if anything.

Hel/Hela is actually Loki's illegitimate daughter, as was Fenrir/Fenris Wolf, the big wolf she was petting in Thor: Ragnarok, as well as Jormungundr, the Midgard serpent.  

In conclusion, Thor's biological brothers are Baldr, Vithr, and Bori (and possibly more identified by Sturluson, but unconfirmed by other traditional sources). Loki is Thor's (kind of) uncle, Hela is his cousin, and I am a know-it-all douchebag who likes to listen to lectures on YouTube, read some Neil Gaiman, and acts like some kind of scholar on the matter when in fact I'm just some grease monkey in Southern Oregon with no college education and barely made it through high school.  Also Thor is supposed to have red hair. See? I can't even help myself. Are you still reading this? At this point it's on you. You're an enabler. I hope you're happy with yourself.",1

Basically: There are a shitload of species and habitable worlds in this galaxy. The Asgardians conquered 8, those (+Asgard) became the nine realms (from the Thor movies), which were connected with the Bifrost, also called the rainbow bridge. Earth is one of them, together with Muspelheim, Svartalfheim, Jotunheim, Nidavellir‚Ä¶

All other worlds are not connected to the Bifrost, so you need a spaceship to go there and there are hyperlanes as well (Guardians 2) and wormholes (Thor 3, Sakaar is surrounded by them), so worlds like Xandar, Hala, Knowhere, Vormir, Titan etc. are travelled to that way.

On that note: Its a bit weird, that Heimdall can see and talk to Thor while he's on Sakaar, as it's not part of the nine realms. Heimdalls power is connected to his sword, which can summon the Bifrost, so it should be contained to the nine realms.",1

O7a10a_D8nE,HONEST TRAILERS MOVIE FIGHTS ROUND 1,"Mixed in with a lot of nostalgic love is the white hot crusading force for justice: Harvey Dent. He may not have the REALLY nostalgic appeal of Lincoln or the Farleyness of Callahan, but in the scope of his backstory (and I'm not super into the comics, so I'm going by the Pervasive Nolan Standard (PNS) pronounced correctly by academics and research psychologists as [pee-n] - [uss), a hallowed law of popular culture by which a film maker, writer or sometimes actor will groove so hard to their own jam they miss the memo of whats trending and basically do as they will. In Nolan's case he was able to give us Harvey's story which showed how much he had done for Gotham City. The Dark Knight and The Sun Also Rise-s suggest that in the time between Two-Face's death and when we rejoin Limpin' Bruce Pimp eight years later on the rooftop overlooking the party AND THAT PRICK COPS A FEEL ON CATWOMAN?? He so desrved what he got. Anyway, the Commissioner (Gordon) wants to tell the truth about Harvey, but not before he acknowledges the amazing work they've able to do by ""Giving law enforcement teeth"", and essentially all jerking into a mason jar and throwing it on each other about how great Harvey was not only as a pillar of the community but a person able to affect amazing changes WITHOUT WEARING A MASK (as Batman says) . To summerise: Harvey Dent is my favourite movie lawyer. His one prominent scene was so underplayed and all but forgotten about after Joker [Applies insensitive racial stereotype of Tyler Perry as the Mama] ""throws some a dat context up in da fraaaame... Ooooh Luurrrrrd!"" We see Harvey in full DA mode disarm a dude with an Italian last name (Eric Roberts isn't even Italian, but he pulls off the Bawss role perfectly because he's just that greasey (I can say that because my Great Great Grandad on my Dad's adopted side may have lived in Naples). The way he's obviously shaken but seems to have a good understanding of what he's signed up for leads the viewer to believe, and Nolan does this in almost every project he's involved with, We're feeling feelings while we watch a film like TDK or BB that you don't have when you watch Man of Steel or Superman IV or A Serbian Film (if that's a headspace you feel like being in). Atticus Finch was a great film Lawyer because he stood up for the downtrodden, as was his sweet nature, and we watched that over 129 mins until his arc went back to one. In the Nolan Batverse (and anyone inside PNS will back me up. If there's one thing that makes us happy it's when the PNS stands tall against a slippery slope and finds a way inside all of us. At once) we are confronted with what Nolan may refer to as his ""Artistic Expressionism through Writing dense narratives around different fundamental emotions we all have (In chronilogical order...) Fear, Chaos and Pain. And if you go back to Memento through the Prestige, Inception and Interstellar, the confusion itself is the motivator, not necessarily the characters either, we as audience members are sucked into vaguely themed worlds where uncertainty rules. I truly believe his handling of Two Face in TDK was so rich coming from the page and acted by Aaron Eckhart and directed by one of the writers? That's why it's so dense. He's a lawyer for the good guys and he cleaned up Gotham like a Clint Eastwood sherriff in the late 1800's, or if you prefer the classic Dirty Harry with it's incredible take 4 mil against 36? Bruce Willis and company could never blow it out like that and they have brand awareness and nostalgia on their side. To quote you wonderful writers; ""Die Hard as a revenge movie in and around Central Park in 1970"" was a gritty feel. We love Harvey Dent because he's a good guy and he makes a difference, a lot of hero movies stomp on the story until the script details that he/won, but not entirely...Automatic Sequel. Well if you made it this far; Spencer J. KILLBERT (RAWWWWRRR) and Joe ""That is also my name!"" Starr thanks for your arguments (Lincoln won out of the two of you)... But ""Damn Daniel (rockin' the white VAAAAANNS)"", as a two acrobat show (Steven Speilberg or Batman depending on whether the audience feels really old or ARE really old) I expected a little more ""Face-Time""... Did any of you consider Harvey as the crusading, good to the last drop kinda American hero Gotham, if not every other city in the Free 52, could only hope to wish for. If it wasn't for the Joker he would never become TF and as an audience I feel it reflects our hope (actually the underlying focus of Shawshank Redemption but more on that in my next overly long discussion piece on my favourite channel on YouTube). Dan I thought you were going to rep Gotham... But I guess I was wrong :(      

I'm just playin' but thanks to another great piece of content. I love all you guys.

Jon if you can say ""Mimeticpolyaloy..."" with Arnold's Terminator voice.... Dude...

Its more like going into school to watch the debate team. I understand you cant please everybody, and things had to be different to make a point, but was there really a person who voted for less players and no chairs?",1
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Liking the new format, a lot less people talking over each other or debates getting out of control with two fighters, which is good as some fighters were pretty shouty, although I think you're gonna have to be careful to get fresh people on plenty with one less fighter.
That said, a couple bits of feedback on it:
* I think you really should have made Dan go first on the sabotage question, as he got to have first choice of his opponent's argument, (the rationale of making the person arguing the first answer go first was to even out the advantage slightly) he can always take a few seconds to think before starting. It's sticking the boot in to have the person who answered second have to start first on those.
* We should also hear from the presenter/host even when their vote is moot to the final decision, just so we know if it was 3-0 or 2-1, and also because they might have relevant thoughts that will sell the audience more on the decision if it is 3-0, or placate those of us who disagree when it's 2-1.
* I'm undecided on whether the audience having a vote on the main questions is a good idea or not- I think sometimes the audience got it right when judges didn't in the past, but that overall they're probably less reliable. That might be something to consider in this new format, especially as there's nothing to prevent the live audience voting with an agenda.
* You're gonna have to be much more careful about having even matchups in a 1v1 format. In a 1v1v1, it's not a huge deal if one of the fighters is outclassed as long as another can keep up with the leader, so hopefully you'll either be careful to put newer fighters against each other, or come up with a sort of tournament structure for rating them.",1

u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"HUGE mistake to have only two fighters. It doesn't allow for dynamic fighting, like where one fighter has to choose to argue against one or the other and ends up helping the others case. There's just less structural drama.",1

Love all of the changes, but sometimes a player could have a off day, and the other two players end up saving what could have been a weak episode.  Also the third fighter can even out the validity of the question.  Once in a while there could be a wayyyyyyy of the wall answer that if in a two player format might not pan out well.  Standing up I agree with a lot of the other comments to stiff and ridged.  Love the more casual sit down.  A place to place the belts, water or drinks....

Just my two cents as a long-time fan: I'm ok with the new format (the set does need work though - it's a bit too formal...what happened to the good old days with all the geeky action figures and movie memorabilia?), and I, like most people on here, seem to like everyone sitting down rather than standing up. But meh, those are small things. 

The questions and arguments are still as good as ever!  I hope Roxy will be coming back with TV Fights as well - can't wait to see how she & Billy fare with the new setup (I'm sure they will be awesome, as always).   Can't wait to see the next episode! :)",1

u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Nice format guys. 
I think I prefer the sitting down and 3 fighters format better though. It was less formal and more collected.",1
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I understand the need to completely revamp this show. I prefer the new set, because all those screens that absolutely showed nothing but the logo always, always bothered me to no end, what a waste of screens. I do think if you are going to go this route, it should now be titled, Movie Debates. 

Having three fighters was always a little chaotic, people talking over each other, I don‚Äôt know how one judge ever figured out what they were saying and then when they did not, it was dullard episode. 

I never liked the previous judge, he now clearly in the light is a terrible person altogether, but he was just an inconsistent ‚Äújudge.‚Äù And it was always a thrill when somebody else guest judged. I think the host should rotate out always. 

I am commenting on this just upfront before I watch the full thing because I don‚Äôt know when I‚Äôll finish. I just wanted to say that I‚Äôm glad it‚Äôs back, I‚Äôm glad it‚Äôs different. It still needs a heavy dose of energy, but I think by keeping it shorter, a lot shorter, this is a massive improvement.",1

I prefer when you guys sit because everyone seems more comfortable and it's a bit more welcoming. As far as 2 fighters as opposed to 3..it worked this time. And it works when both fighters are great/strong in their own ways. But if you happen to have a fighter who turns out to be a dud or a somewhat of a bore, 2 fighters will be a lot harder to watch.

I think you should have triple threats and big fatal four way fights in the future too though. I love the new format but I liked seeing the opinion of more than two fighters, it was great to have three differing opinions and seeing the arguments against them.

Bring in old favourites and new fighters in 2018 to start from scratch with the old records being rebooted... fighters like Harloff, Ellis, Napzok, Mike Carlson, Scott Mantz, Roger Barr, Alicia Malone, JTE, Marc Andreyko, Max Landis, Jason Inman, Chris Stuckman, John Campea, Jon Schnepp, Mark Reilly, Josh Macuga etc.

Most people are already saying this, but the three person format did add a level of uniqueness to your debates that was pleasant (though there are obvious benefits to the two person format, such as: better organization, it being easier to keep track of everyone's comments and giving everyone a turn to speak and respond to each other).

u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"ScreenJunkies, I‚Äôm excited to see you back in action! Hal as host is a babe: mid-round questions is lovely. Enjoying the change of background and I‚Äôm liking the idea of the new set up for games, and vote by audience but I feel like the audience could just go for whoever entertained them or if they just vote based on their opinion. For example, if you ever had Max Landis back and people didn‚Äôt like his argument style, they‚Äôd vote the opposite just because. 
I also prefer the contrast of the 3 Fighters just because I like more varied takes on the same topic, and I agree with some of the other commenters that by having everyone standing, it‚Äôs lost it‚Äôs ‚Äúwe‚Äôre just mates that love movies sat around talking about movies‚Äù aspect, which is how we fans truly can connect with the show. It looks a lot more professional now, and that could be a great thing for you, but I just think the nerd memorabilia, a couple of chairs, and a coffee mug even on the cool new podiums would just help get that little bit of community back. 

I know you‚Äôre ever going to see this and a one in a 1000 comment is never really that relevant, but comments are just that. Still enjoying seeing everyone back to what they love again though, and excited to follow the journey for another couple of years like I have before

EDIT: wanna just add on the side that I hope that ScreenJunkies don‚Äôt feel like we are unsupportive. Some fans will find it hard to adjust, but the mass majority just want to help rebuild the show that we loved, and they loved to make, but no go back to the past. I hope the little knick nacks, memorabilia, and decorations being gone now will be good if you start to bring it back slowly because it‚Äôll be like ScreenJunkies rebuilding their identity with us all over again.",1

-2 fighters : not bad as such, fairer from the game point of view, but 3 makes for more random nonsense, which is more fun to watch.

I honestly don't even watch many movies but I watched Movie Fights every week because it was entertaining to see people passionately (and sometimes chaotically) debate movies they felt strongly for.

I definitely appreciate the huge reduction in fighters talking over each other. I think the point/counterpoint style does a lot for the quality of the debate and the respect between fighters. 

I wouldn‚Äôt have thought it would make a difference, but the canned applause after a winner is announced might help with the energy? Or a faster pace from the host? I would also love to see the third fighter return. The three person dynamic was a highlight.",1

I'm not sure how I like the new format, but it's like with any other change, I'm sure I'll get used to it. There is one thing that I think doesn't work -- the fan vote. I understand the thought behind it, but I honestly think that takes something away from the show. People are biased and I think the judges in this need to have some proven level of expertise and be nonbiased. Not sure how I feel about the two contestant thing either, but I know that's more of a personal reaction to change rather than a this doesn't work for the show..

I agree with people saying that there should be three people, it just makes it more fun to watch and everyone should sit down.

I enjoy seeing the score and future arguments on the side bar and three judges is great as well, less room for bias. I am disagreeing with most in the chat about giving the public a vote. however maybe give the host and fact checker their vote first and in case of a tie... go to the poll.

Maybe make the background theme a more cinema-esque theme as well.

Great job guys, glad you're back!",1
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I am so glad Movie Fights is back. I love the adding of 3 judges.


My gripes: I think 3 fighters was better.

Bring back chairs and a table, them standing was just making me feel anxious and doesn't feel like they were comfortable. This new ""debate format"" looks like they are arguing about politics, not movies with their friends/colleagues. The round table, comfy seats for an hour and half, was never a problem. This is way too formal for the theme of ""Movie Fights"". 

Turn on the lights and add some warm-ness to the set. Please. Make the room more nerdy, more light-hearted.. Add knick knacks and movie posters and life back into the room. 
I get wanting to start fresh, but you guys kind of stripped away all of the love and fun in the room. I feel like they're hanging out in a cold cellar and not a nerd den. 

Work on the overlay/UI. It's so bulky and distracts from the fighters. Don't bother with the side bar, or put that information all at the bottom third of the screen. You don't even need to list the questions in the side bar, just put that in the Youtube Description box with timecodes. Just have the question and the score at the bottom third. Make the boxes surrounding them smaller too. The ratio of text to outlined box isn't right.",1

- two fighters instead of three makes the arguments a little more stale but it can still be great I think if you take advantage of the new format

im not quite sure if i enjoy the 1 v 1 as much as a 3 people free for all though. it feels more like a debate and less like friends discussing some movie topics. its definetly entertaining, but in a different way. I'm looking forward to the next one! 
some small things: 
- the audio is a bit far away at times. if you want to have everyone standing up, thats cool, but they either have to bow down into the mic, basically eat it, at all times, or you should look into using a LAV mic, so they can move freely without loosing audio quality when leaning back. 
- i dont know if the audience vote is a good idea. as we saw in the past, the biggest and or latest released movie will basically always win that vote, regardless of the argument. i think it would be better to have that audience vote as a tie breaker. 
all in all, i love that you guys are working on it and trying to improve the show! thanks for sticking with it guys :)",1

u8MeW2r_qq0	Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!	Fun new format, thank you for bringing back movie fights! I only have one suggestion. Hal is a great host, but I think he needs a bigger role in voting. He should have the final say on who gets the point, while taking input from everyone else, with the fan vote not being revealed until after. Without one person having the final vote, it feels like the judging has less personality as everyone is more likely to agree or be swayed in a certain direction.

u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,I enjoyed the show but I do think the 3 fighter format would be better implemented in this format,1
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Things I enjoy:

- The side bars
     They give information in a concise format, and have a great aesthetic.

- Hal as judge
     Ten outta ten in general.

- Set aesthetic
     Love the cool feel, and proffesional tone.

Things I feel could be improved:

- # of fighters
    I feel that having three fighters allowed for more complex, or even interesting, ideas to be bounced on each other. Two feels like it could limit some of the fights.

- Standing/Podiums
   Not a huge complaint, but I feel that the show seems more stiff than the usual fights because of the standing. Not as much of a relaxing attitude that allowed for some humor. Seriousness is good, but I feel that a integrel part of the show was its relaxing, comfy atmospere.

Love the fact the show is coming back, and hope see some more as soon as possible!",1
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,I liked the old movie fights format more to be honest.,1

u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"i think you the idea of three judges one of them being the live viewers is awesome.
i would change it a bit though..
the two screen junkies judges on set should say who they believe won the fight and you should go to fans for the tie breaker.
i think this makes a lot more sense and would be a better choice in cases like we saw before in movie fights when a much newer film is going up against a classic or less popular movie.",1

I‚Äôm excited to see where you guys take this and I‚Äôll continue to support!",1

u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Hal is suitable for a moderator/judge, but the lack of a third fighter make these fights too tame.

Yes i do prefer the previous format but I love the 3 judges, and I like Hall! Ruth is great too! It will be great if different people are judges like Alicia, she bring so much to this show !  I like that the public has a vote but i would not like that the score is dependent on thefan factor and not the sharpness of the arguments! Anyways happy that the show is back! ‚ù§Ô∏è",1
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,I was hoping this would come back but wow. I like change but this is just weird. Looks like I have to bring cartoon fights back üëå,1
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Here's my critique on the new format: Positives: I LOVE the rundown. I've been wanting that for the longest time. KEEP THAT not matter what. Also, I love the scoreboard. Has a sporting even feel and you can begin watching anytime and know who's winning. And I like the new scoring system. Makes the viewers feel like they're important to the show and eliminates the ""rigged"" notion from the one judge system. Negatives: HATE the podiums. I get that you're trying to make this look organized but this makes me think I'm watching a political debate and makes it too formal and not loose and fun. This also wouldn't work when you bring in guest fighters like Kevin Smith or Seth Rogan. Also, the color palate for the set sucks. This looks like the Ellen Degeneres show set. This is Movie Fights. There should be movie posters on the wall. Now I don't hate the one on one format, but it does take away from the zaniness that tents to happen with 3, and even sometimes 4 fighters. I can live with this as long as you loose the formal setting.  Suggestions: Bring back the bell. You don't have to use Andy's hammer but someone just saying TIME just doesn't work. Plus it gives a boxing feel to a fight. Also, a more energetic host. I like Hal, but his jokes are lame and he interrupts too much. And, bring in a roundtable. Gives the option for more fighters and keeps it chill and fun. You know, watching this fight, it just seemed like they were walking on eggshells a little, trying not to push the envelope. But that's just boring. Cut loose guys, let 'er rip.",1
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I like this new style, however, maybe limit Hal (or who ever hosts) to maybe 1 or 2 additional questions per point questions.",1
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Can we edit in different pants/legs on Hal's podium every movie fights now?,0
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,I miss the old movie fights format. Nothing about this is better. Two fighters is boring. Audience should never ever get a vote because they will never listen to the argument fairly.,1
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Thank you all for a great show. Love Hal as host. The comically big podium made him look so tiny, though. Love the crew laughing in the background.",1
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"This 7 round shorter version is amazing! I loved it. I think the 2 fighter thing could be a cool new idea that we are just not used to yet. But please bring the table back with the judge in the middle and the two fighters on the sides.

Love you guys and keep up the great work!",1

u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Things I liked: I like Hal as a judge and the questions he was asking as follow up were solid because they didn't really favor one contestant over the other. I like that Roth and Hal really explained their answers instead of just saying how tough it was. 

The things I didn't like: I prefer the table to the podiums. It just felt more casual and laid back, which is great for a show like this. I think after using this and a few one on one fights, that the one on one fights should be for the belt alone. The three person set up is way more fun and you get multiple arguments. The multiple arguments are important to me because it keeps one person from trouncing on the other and controlling the whole fight. With a third voice in there, there's a lesser chance that happens.",1

u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I really enjoyed this new fighting style but I do miss the three fighters and the bell sounds, also I hated Thor Ragnarok and Logan was the best superhero movie of 2017",1
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,OMFG! I am SO glad that Movie Fights is back!!! Hell Damn YES!,1
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"My take on 2017's superhero movies:

Logan: Phenomenal. Paced and acted incredibly well. Easily the best superhero film of 2017. Heck, it's barely a superhero movie. It's more of a postapocalyptic drama that just happens to involve a superhero. I'd nominate Hugh and Stewart for Oscars.

Ragnarok: Hell of a fun movie. Loved the lighter, but still serious, take on the Thor films and I feel it's the best of the three. Plus, the use of Led Zeppelin's ""Immigrant Song"" twice elevated the movie even more.

Wonder Woman: Fantastic. Gal was awesome as the title character and Patty Jenkins brought a breath of fresh air to DC in the franchise's only good movie in its canon. The DK trilogy is the best, but that isn't technically DC. 

Homecoming: Very, very fun. Holland is my favorite Spider-Man, with Maguire doing the best at the nerdy Peter aspect. Keaton was fantastic as the villain.

Guardians 2: Very fun film. The soundtrack and action were both great and the characters are likable as ever. Had a great time watching it.

Justice League: Seeing it Monday. Heard it's fun but a meh movie overall.

In a nutshell: Marvel proved it can go above and beyond, and is incredibly consistent with the quality of their films. DC showed promise with WW, but destroyed some of that progress with JL and has shown that is still inconsistent and can't get a grip on what they need to do.",1

u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I like Hal as the host, interesting follow up questions that add more depth to the fight ie the lightsaber question",1
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I honestly don‚Äôt mind the 2 fighters, they constantly complained about ‚Äògoing long‚Äô and the 1 hour format lets people discuss more, with less questions. Also means that if they manage to bring on celeb fighters it fits better with an hourly schedule that a lot of them seem to have.

I really prefer the cluttered desk to the ‚Äòslick‚Äô podiums though. We don‚Äôt need yet more political style debating. More like two friends fighting on a comfy couch while a movie plays in the background.",1
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,I would like to see it a little more casual and conversational still but I like it.,1

MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"yes I was missing this so much, lets celebrate movie fights is back, I agree with Thor ragnarok, ¬†I love Logan for what it is, I would love to read the comic book is based on, and hopefully see a hulk vs wolverine since Disney has the rights, also Logan has a movie reference that my dad saw but to be honest, it was pretty dim, I would have to say Spiderman homecoming, my second is thor, Logan, wonder woman, justice league. ¬†don't miss with die hard its dead, no coming back, I would do Simpson movie sequel with Star Wars make a movie that has tropes of both, that would be cool but the crossover I would like to see hulk vs wolverine movie since the birth of comics of wolverine came from that, for me its a tie, I would love to see both, die hard for zootopia almost a spoof I would like to be honest I mean they were going to make fun of spy movies like James Bond early on, and the predator and pirates good research, that would be dope. why didn't dan say do a adaptation of the comic book predator 1718, that would be both arguments, actually a have another idea, is Simpson and die hard they can make a real Mcbain movie from the Simpsons franchise, do and early movie, that would be dope. anyways it would be a Simpson sequel since the Simpson are in the plaza, that Mcbain saves. I'm not a big Star Wars guy so I don't care, who ever got the best points I guess.",1

u8MeW2r_qq0	Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!	""i dont hate the format. i think its good for a more intense fight, or series of fights ie a 1v1 fight for the belt or a tournament to determine a top contender for the belt. but outside of that i would have to agree with some of the other comments; standing behind podiums feels a little too formal and serious as opposed to the old set up of sitting around the table which had a more friendly and casual atmosphere which (combined with having 3 fighters) lends itself to funnier arguments and more entertaining fights.
i dont mind the fan vote, as long as the results dont become a popularity contest. i know in the past there have been a lot of instances of the polls being a popularity contest, but that was the twitter polls, in which anyone could vote regardless of whether or not they were watching, not the live youtube polls. and since the youtube polls are only available to those watching live, i dont see it becoming as big a problem as it was before",1

I hope u have a set host except for Classic Movie Fights with Alicia Malone (P.S please in the future bring that back) but for the majority have a set host. Also I didn‚Äôt like the blue bit around the bottom but was find but found blue bit pointless. But I thought this was amazing and I loved that Spencer and dan went head to head love the polls being more involved in the decision making and the fact you have three judges thought that was great and it will stop with people sayin its bias (which I never thought anyway) but I enjoyed seeing u all together debating films again it was lovely but see u all in 2018 with this show and well done everyone from Billy to Lon to Spencer etc we can tell u have all worked so hard and will continue too on making a fantastic show for all us nerds to watch hehe glad ur back guys,1
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,I would like to see both fighters in the same frame so y'all don't have to cut back and forth to see their reactions to the arguments. Lighting also seems kinda dim?

I got discovered you guys via Honest Trailers but didn't start paying attention till the...revamp. After that you guys became my first foray into the World of You Tube shows.
Since then I have been watching and enjoying your content on a whole other level of interest and enjoyment but had never seen a Movie Fight. Really liked it. I had Spencer taking the first round but thought Dan really took over after that. Fair play! I would watch both crossovers - but only if they took out the Hans Grouper character; this must remain unsullied by parody.",1

u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I agree with other comments that this new format is a bit too formal, both in its visual layout and structure. The podiums as well as the back and forth debate questions take away a bit of the personable quality and atmosphere that the old format had. Oddly enough I think the bit of chaos of the old format made it more enjoyable to watch. If there is a middle ground between the two, I think that would make viewers happy.",1
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I echo a lot of what has already been said. I totally understand the reasons behind re-vamping, and im sure any change will take some adjustment. However, I also enjoyed the organic feel and nature of the old format. The old way may have been more chaotic, less organized, and even maybe less ""fair"", but it had more energy and personality. 

I think the current format may be a little too debatecentric. I think most fans watched movie fights to experience and enjoy the people. I also agree that the 3 fighter format was better. Whatever system brings back the energy and the Screen Junkie personality is what i'd like to see!

Either way I love and support you guys! 

PS. Hal is a great judge but I think Roxy is the best!",1
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I NEVER comment on YouTube videos but wanted to take a second to let you know what I liked and disliked on the new format.

Overall a little disappointing return (this coming from someone who didn't enjoy the previous guy's onscreen presence - even before everything came out). It does time some time to get used to new things, so I'm not jumping ship yet. However, there were 3 things that lead to my disappointment, listed in order of importance.
1. The visuals of the stage. It looked like a political debate which was probably the point, but it came across very cold and less friendly than when everyone was sitting around the table. I can understand the desire for a visual change, but I think that could still be accomplished by making other changes and leaving the sitting around the table vibe going. 
2. Two fighters. I'm still thinking through this one. In the long run I may end up liking this better but for now, I wish there was a third contestant. Hard pressed to say exactly why though if I'm honest.
3. Some of Hal's questions in the middle of the arguments were strange and took the fight into a weird place (ie the monologue question).

Things I liked
1. 3 main questions and then 4 speed round questions. This worked well for me.
2. Roth and Danielle were great on the sideline (though I love when Danielle is a competitor)
3. I think the new scoring is ""more fair"" and less at the whims of 1 person. Roth (that position) obviously has the most sway, but can still be outvoted if the other ""two"" disagree with her. Also I agreed with every decision Roth made. I would like to see the judges have to ""lock"" in their decision before the other judges give their vote to ensure there are no shenanigans.
4. I loved Dan's point about having fun and arguing these movies without getting to a nasty point. Much more enjoying able.",1
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"The ADVANTAGE OF 3 FIGHTERS:  it adds more of a 'movie nerds arguing in the basement' feel that is so relatable for us all.  It also provides more on-set laughing, joking, and interaction between the contestants.  All that being said.  Welcome back Movie Fights! I've missed you and I'll always remain a fan",1
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I kind of agree with the others, you should let the fighters sit down! Also, I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs just me but the lighting seems a bit harsh.",1

u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"If they do insist on sticking to this new format then I think they should do what the schmoedown has done and have different belts. Have the regular belt, a classic belt, Fantasy Sci-fi, etc. Would get people excited for there being entire matches dedicated to a genre of movies they are passionate about and give certain fighters advantages in what they are passionate in.

Sometimes at three, one was clearly left undermine and the fighters had a lot more to talk about since they had to defend their movie, but also crap on two others. Now, it's really easier to compare between only two and say why your movie is better. Also, three judges is a really great idea, it takes away the ""personnal"" factor that one judge could have of like, voting for his or hers personnal opinion instead of the argument. And only three questions is enough, with the speed round, i think this is a nearly perfect format. The standing does remind me of a game show and might be tiring for the contestant and the audience as vote is not that bad, you should however write ""Dan or Spencer"" instead of the movies, because people will just vote for their favorite movie and it won't be base on the argument.

Because I don‚Äôt know who would want to stand at a podium arguing for that long besides Dan (no offense, I love you).
3. Only two panelists, again, no more outside guests? That feels like a long argument rather than an open discussion.
4. Rotating hosts? I‚Äôm hoping
If there‚Äôs no more TV Fights, I‚Äôm hoping for Roxy (even though I like her a lot more as a fighter).

That said.
I like the idea of less rounds, to make it go by faster.

u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Personally, the set seems lifeless and something totally unlike the Screen Junkies would make or have for a set. For example, the Screen Junkies News set is colorful and unique but fitting to this channel's character, which makes the video more fun to watch! I love this show to bits and I'm very happy its back with two of my favorite fighters, but I just wish they would carry on with the old set. I understand it probably feels tainted or might be even hard to look at the same, but it's that set we are comfortable with and enjoy, regardless of who's there, or in this case who's not there. Whatever they do from here I understand, but this is just my own personal preference.",1

Maybe having a third can be tested in a future episode? The new format may not have the over the top energy as the original but i'll take that over it just being a shouting match.,1

u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"There are a lot of comments on the format (2 fighters, standing up). I think it really comes down to the framing. It is very top heavy.",1
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,That Zootopia pitch sounds like an abortion of a movie and I cannot fathom why anyone would want to watch that.,0
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"My biggest complaint is with the display graphics. The screen is way too busy for what they're doing. The question queue on the left is completely unnecessary. They don't even fill the space fully and it wastes valuable real estate on the screen. If you're going to show the current question on the bottom of the screen anyways then the short version on the left is just a redundancy. There was no issue with going to the description for questions if you wanted to look ahead. That feature would be better served if consolidated in a new bottom screen banner and not distributed around the screen. I'd rather see the fighters full screen with graphics superimposed and not a shrunken screen with all this needless clutter. Then that ""Interact live on twitter"" is so out of place and distracting to me. I get that it's just the bottom by their hands, but if you are going to waste the screen space to separate the actual video from the information display then do it and keep them distinctly apart. This third floating rectangle doesn't fit with the text or color of the left display, and it doesn't fit with the text or color of the bottom display either. It's just kinda there and I hate it. Get rid of the left display, and consolidate the twitter plug to the bottom banner.

I also just don't really like the new set in general. It's dark and lacking in personality with all the squares everywhere. I would just put up some shelves and pack them with movie boxes or action figures like they do with every other set. Also add some chairs to the podiums. From a body language perspective a person sitting at a table is far more comfortable looking and inviting than someone standing behind a podium and constantly having to shift from leg to leg uncomfortably. Having it be an option to sit or stand would be the way to go.

It also lacked that casual feeling of sitting around the table and talking about movies. Old Movie Fights had the tendency to go off the rails, but it had nothing to do with the format of the show. It was a shit judge letting people get out of hand. All Movie Fights really needed was a judge who could keep people on topic and some rules banning stuff like the racist/sexist argument or the Spencer tactic of putting words in your mouth. The comedy is fine, but when you start applying someone else's ideas to the original pitch you're being a bad judge. seaQuest DSV was a great answer, Spencer joked about it, Andy let it ruin his judgement despite not actually being part of the actual pitch.

Overall I enjoyed the content of the episode. I will hold off on my official opinion of the format until I've seen a few more people on. Someone like a Mike Carlson might liven up the game and bring some levity into the show. The Dan vs. Spencer fight was good. Hal was fine other than asking Dan for the pirate/predator bromance conversation. That was the classic Spencer putting words in your mouth tactic where the actual argument presented gets undercut by the fabricated apparent argument. To me this really felt like an overcorrection in the format and a misfire on the set dressing. Other than that it's not too different in actual content or function to really complain about. I preferred the 3 fighter elimination style to the best of 7 style, but I'll give this the fair shot it deserves. There is nothing preventing them from adjusting the format as they see fit. Any tweaks or changes can be made at literally any time. If this was the beta test for the 2018 season then this is my feedback. Take from it what you will.",1

u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I actually like the 2 person format a lot. Yes it is similar to Schmoedown, but as someone who got into podcasts and vidcasts like this because of Movie Fights, I started to drift away toward Schmoedown because the records weren't there, and it didn't feel like any of these fights were building toward anything. Records being wiped, and allowing people to go 1vs1 means this format can build towards a watch every week show. 
If it means we don't have a 3rd fighter, I'm ok with that. If you can find a middle ground where there are 3 fighters and fights build into a league more, I think you'll find that pleases the most fans.",1

u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"If you guys are gonna continue this three main fight format, then I think the current format of questions works REALLY well. First, an analytical question that's about arguing why x is better/worse/whatever than y, Second a Pitch question and Third a special round, that mixes it up. Scrap Trick Questions, and start doing more backward fights, or maybe a round that your answer gets picked by your opponent, or really just anything to mix it up, like a wildcard round.",1

u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"This feels like a presidential debate, my only criticism is there should be three fighters and Yalls should be sitting. Be comfortable, reason I liked the show was cause it was informal, buncha friends sitting down arguing about movies. I also prefer the five questions and then five speed round questions, but that's just cause it provides more content.",1
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Loved the new format! The new judging system is awesome, especially the inclusion of the viewers. Hal makes a great host and I love his questions to stir the fight a little bit, I think it really helps the structures of the fight and brings in new perspectives and arguments. I'm also really looking forward to seeing Danielle on the couch every week! (Is it now the Dan & Danielle Cam? The DaniDan Cam? The double Dan cam? The Dan x 2 Cam? I'm getting carried away, sorry.) The set will take some getting used to, but I like the frame with an overview, I think it'll be really helpful for people like me who like to skip fights if they don't know anything about the movies or the topic. It'll make it easier to keep track of the points. Basically I can't wait for movie fights to be weekly again!! :D",1

u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I think that the best way to balance the new format and old format, is to alternate them. Do this once a fortnight, a well-mannered two person DEBATE about films, and then the older format with three fighters FIGHTING(with words) about films. Because I like both formats myself. I think that this format suits the more DEBATE side of Movie Fights, so Classic Fights and whatnot, whereas  the original format suits best for the more fun fights, such as Drunk Fights.

Aside from that, multiple judges = good but I agree with the masses that being sat down would be more comfortable for everyone involved. And maybe a tad bit less like it's a game show all around, but it might be an alright idea after we've had a couple Fights.",1
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,I think the guys forgot Inception. Dom Cobb is one pf the most developed character in Movies. and then they question Chris Nolan's skills. And also go watch Memento and The Prestige.,1

u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,I liked the more relaxed format.  I also liked that with the three people there was more variety of points of view as well as feeling more friendly.  This just pits two people against each other instead of the more round table effect of the last format.  I'm glad they're continuing the program despite the past.  It's healthy to confront the bad and then move forward with the hope of making the future better.,1

The only thing I will say is me personally think it's better if you guys are sitting down. Seems more like a fun talk that way not so much a debate.

We're also missing something in the camera shots of the judges.  It feels cramped and slapped together.  Give 'em some space. You gotta get chairs and get back to 3 fighters.  2 fighters is too much like Schmoedown.  The chaos is part of the fun of the show and you've lost that.,1
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I'm happy to see that your team didn't let Movie Fights go. It's smart to try a new format with new twists, to set yourself apart from the previous way of doing this, which is unfortunately tainted now. The sabotage round is a great idea. I've seen every fight, but don't remember that type of question. To me, it's new, and I love it. Hal did a great job, and I like how he threw fun questions in to each fighter. That's a great mediator. Still, though, 3 people is better. And sitting down felt more laid back, and, like someone said below, was like a group of friends hanging and debating fun topics. I'm with you whichever way you go, I just hope this isn't the set in stone way moving forward. Keep innovating, there's so much potential here",1

I generally like Hal, but I'd REALLY like Roxy Striar to host this. The only change I'm not crazy about is switching to only two fighters. I much prefer having three fighters, both because it opens the fights up to more opinions and because I think the arguments are better when you have to defend against two different styles of arguments.

The contestants were too far from the mic and I could hear the sound of the room. Even the sync of the audio was bad. The show lost the casual feel it had which was more enjoyable. I started watching and got bored after a while. Everything felt so cold including the set which was great before... it looked so commercialized. Exactly the reason I don‚Äôt watch tv shows.

There is no feeling in this anymore... we need to feel like a fight, like a raw matching of wits and grit. 3 or more fighters, not less! we are not children nor ADHD victims, we can hadle more then an hour of show. stand down, let the people relax so that they can engage the deeper meanings, not politicize standing up like assholes (we got that part covered already). Also, you brought the whole team today to show support and that you are united, and that's fine but pleeeease, lose everyone but the judge and the fact checker (he can manage the polls also), cause in this case I don't care about Screen Junkies, I care about the fighters.

I have to say I liked the more casual 3 fighters sitting down together than this new two fighters standing up format. I am also not a fan of the new judging score, where the host is not the judge. Would prefer if Hal had the casting vote. Other than that OWSOME!",1
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Really digging the set! I like the visuals of this new set such as the left bar, the title heads, new logo, etc. I love that you guys are cutting down on the amount of questions (3 rounds as opposed to 5). And I love that you now have more than one judge!! So much better than putting it all on one individual.

I 100% agree with everyone else that I‚Äô do not like the standing podiums. I think they would be great to pull out during a championship match but I miss the informality of a bunch of ‚Äúgeeks‚Äù sitting at a table together. It felt more relaxed and more inviting as a viewer. I do feel like the banter is so much better with three fighters and it is great seeing three different perspectives.

It may take time in order for things to fall back into place the way that works best for you guys- So glad to see Movie Fights back!",1

MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I think if you want to use a comedy as your standard for greatness, you gotta go The Good Place: innovative, creativy, hilarious, and high stakes that pay off in service of characters, while moving and pushing plot and jokes forward.

Does Thor Raganrok achieve this? Yes, to a degree, but it falls short in the character front, with some more pushing it would have been an absolutely revolutionary superhero comedy, but it settled for being a good comedy, and while that is ok, if it doesn't achieve comedy greatness and as such it can't match the great dramatic stakes and emotional resonance of Logan.

u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Glad to see you guys finally bringing this back and making some changes.  Here are some of my thoughts on them:
- The new set is a bit bland.  I liked that you changed it up, and I like the podiums... Just maybe add some more movie-related decos in the background?  Or maybe, over time as rivalries rise, some ""boxing style"" pictures of previous matchups?
- You got those nice monitors on the front of the podiums, why not put the contestant's score on it?  That way you wouldn't have to keep repeating it.
- I like the 3 judges approach.  Much more fair than before.
- I miss having 3 contestants.  I love the beautiful chaos that would ensue when all 3 were arguing at once.  I feel like it's not really a fight with 2.  Just a debate.
- Great choice of fighters for the re-opening of this show.
- Maybe just a personal thing, but I'd prefer less questions like ""What's the best/worst whatever movie of whatever timeframe?"" and more open-ended/silly questions, because they usually result in much more creativity and humor, which are the reasons I like to watch movie fights.",1

And social media reactions are cool, but don't read them during the speed round. Sloooows it down terribly. When the fight is like 20 min, okay, you read random stuff for a few minutes. But if the fight is like 2 minutes, limit it to 1 or 2 social media reactions.",1
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Guys, this is my two cents. Hal as judge, best thing ever! But the rest... a little underwhelming. Fighters need to stand the whole way through? The set would be OK, but I think I speak on behalf of most of us MF fans when I say, we need the table. Also, having only two fighters makes it a lot more confrontational than it used to be, which is what you said you wanted to avoid. Three fighters make the whole fight much more conversational and informal, with only the last part, the speed round, the culmination of the fight, where it gets a little more raw. Rather than two fighters, I would even like to see four fighters. The ""best of 7"" also limits the show a lot. I understand that maybe you couldn't keep the old format due to legal reasons, but this new format leaves a lot to be desired. Experiment more with it, please. I don't make this comment just to hate the new. I know some changes had to be made. I write it because I love Movie Fights, and I waited patiently for it to come back, and I feel us, the fans, can help you get it to an even higher level than it used to be, through our criticism. I know a lot of work is ahead of you, and behind you, and maybe you cannot focus on everything at once, so we will be patient. All the best for the Screen Junkies!",1

u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Glad your back. Enjoyed the fight. Great work all. 

I like the multiple judges. I'll never vote live as I always watch at a later point but having several either.

The set I don't mind, but I think I preferred the round table style more than the podiums.

I prefer the longer format questions as the fighters can use more arguments to back up there case. So I think I preferred the 5 long questions with a speed round for the top two.

 Which leads me on to my largest comment that having only 2 fighters is in my opinion not as entertaining as the previous format, no where near.

The third fighter would give a further counterpoint that would keep the arguments more fluid. Allowing for a shift. Where as with 2 there seemed to be more of a. ""That's not how I see it"" arguments, which you did get with a 3 person fight but I think it seemed more prominent.

But as I said. Good work all and glad your back fighting.",1

u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,Great choice of having Hal replace he who shall not be named. Set is modern I dig it. Format is gonna take some getting used to..

u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,I'm all for you guys changing things to make it feel fresh and different from the tainted memories of the old format... but please get some stools or something.,1
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I have to disagree with all the people in the comments saying they prefer the 3-person fights. Those worked when the show was in its infancy and everybody was more interested in having a discussion than in winning, but since the show has evolved into heated debates, one-on-one works a lot better. I enjoyed this a lot more than the more recent pre-Andy-drama episodes as a result of that.

However, I do agree that the set could be more colorful, and I also think the border/overlay takes up too much of the screen. Turns out I'm a lot less invested when the fighters don't fill the whole viewing space, and I feel like the information on the border isn't worth the trade-off.

In spite of those things, I'm really glad Movie Fights is back and I can't wait to see where it goes!",1
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I know its not possible, but...can you please bring back the old format?",1
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Great to have movie fights back and I can tell you have worked hard on this new format. 
But this just does not feel right and felt more stale. The whole debate set felt so serious and not the chill laidback style like before.
Also as many other commented, three fighters is the way to go.
Love you guys and hope you take our voices into account!",1
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,I'm glad the show is back but I'm with the most of the comment section I prefer the table and 3 person fights,1
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I'll agree with many of the comments about the 3 fighter format, it made for more fun debates, plus more room for new fighters.

I like the judging set. Makes for more interesting reasoning as to why someone gets a vote. Also by making the viewer vote a link you ensure that people are probably listening to the arguments before they vote, maybe only make it votable from a certain point in the fight, like only after 5 minutes?

Hal is a great host, That's probably my favorite part of this format, Hal asked interesting questions in the objective opinion rounds and fun questions in the silly rounds, he's fun and funny. Love the whole ""host"" idea

Sabotage is a great mechanic but it shouldn't be in speed round, what would have made that debate really fun is if we'd see them do their all to convince us that those are James Francos best movies. Because they only had the speed round amount it came down to which is not that bad

I can't tell you how happy I am that movie fights are back.",1
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I like the new graphics, and may I just say, let's give this new set some time. I get that first impressions matter, but I think we should give it a chance. Yes, I liked the old one too, maybe even better, but you know what, every now and then you have to bring a new ideas to shows and then accordingly, things like sets and maybe certain rules here and there change too. I guess we as fans and viewers often really like the familiar, because it's comforting, but the show and the whole team had to move forward. After all, it's the people that fight and bring interesting arguments and their knowledge to this show; it's about the debate and taking movies both critically and humorously. I really enjoyed seeing Spencer and Dan fight and thank you for bringing Movie Fights back.
Now, the issue that I personally have (and I get that this is just a sneak peek), is that the same people circle around all the shows at screen junkies, and no offense to anyone, nor the people who make SJ neither the fans. I get that these are the people who basically are SJ; I like seeing Roth, Dan and Spencer on SJU and I watch them every day, but I'm just not sure it works (only FOR ME, PERSONALLY), because conceptually all the shows or specials differ, at least a bit.",1
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I am glad you are back, but I really do prefer to have 3 people debating in the opening round. The pacing seemed better.",1
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,I'll be honest I used to find Hal kind of annoying but he's actually a really good host on this.,1
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"SO HAPPY, to have Movie Fights back and Dan (and Spencer) back in the ring. Hal - well done on the judging, you were very entertaining and fair. 

I really appreciate you tried to improve things and polish them up. Unfortunately I think having 3 fighters made the whole thing more wild and unpredictable - and thus more fun to watch, it was more of a brawl rather than a 1vs1 match. It's Movie Fights rather than Movie Duels after all, if you like.

I am fine with the set I guess, it's a bit sterile as people have said before (nothing from with some personality injection) though I understand why you would want to firm up the branding etc.

Hope you might bring back the three way fights at least occasionally... Thanks and all the best.


P.S. Ragnarok > Logan NO contest!",1

MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I do like three judges, but I don't think the poll should get a vote, do to people mainly chooses based on their opinion not argument. Please go back to three fighters it just brings more content. Dan or Spencer as host/judge, the other as fact checker/judge, and Hal or Roth as pole taker/judge/comment reader. This set is terrible it feels like you game showed this. I enjoy the old set it felt like we were hanging out and cool movie stuff was everywhere.

u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I am so happy this show is back, it feels evil to complain about anything. I'm going to complain now because this seems like the beta version so it's ok? I'm not crazy about the new set, it feels claustrophobic. I miss that desk with all the action figures and stuff; needs more props. And chairs. Comfortable chairs!!! 

Everything else, I like. I like the new format, I like Fawn McClane, and as always Dan and Spen are really good at this, especially that first round.

I don't think you needed to apologize for over the top negativity though, I really didn't get a sense of that before. It was nice to see that kind of drama and passion. Anyway, good stuff.",1
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,I never like the speed rounds much so them being so heavily weighted irks me. I would rather see them just disappear plus they always trip up the guest combatants. I mean I don't mind them having to come up with an title or actor on the spot but I'd rather see the actually fight without the arbitrary time limit. The head to head combat is neat and will probably help the talk loudly so I win problem of old. The Judging isn't bad but I would go to the peoples vote last in the reveal. That way I could hear 2 explainations/view of why someone made a stronger argument after each segment.  I would change up the set behind the host it is kind of a big empty void of dark color.,1

The structure is a welcome addition. Three votes coming from where they do, 's'good. I imagine three participants will return when this new system is comfortable and familiar enough to invite others in. Though, I would hope that invitations will be mindful of the participants behaviour as the previous incarnation of the game often fell into disrespectfully talking over each other, which also made the audio quality of a debate a debacle, irritatingly so.

I would support pulling a third person in - it just adds an extra dynamic and further interest and dimension to have 3 points of view. The free flow arguments of previous movie fights were missing a bit here - Hal added extra questions half way through the fights which I think just took away from the discussion rather than added anything.

The graphics don't look as fun and the 2 person debate style is a little too boring. I miss the fun debates with a third person, usually a wildcard. I don't mind the fan vote but usually the fans don't base it off of the actual argument and I remember the Dan-Mike Carlson fight where each round kept getting 50/50.

Second, I had this idea that I think could work really well. It's called ""Plan B"" fights. After both fighters give their answer, a ""Plan B"" fight is declared, similar to ""Trick Question"". The two answers already given are scrapped and the contestants pick two new answers. For some questions, some choices are really predictable, and having a second-pick would shine the spotlight on some less-popular films. Also, it would mean we get to see the contestants really think on their feet and show off their deeper film knowledge. That was just a thought I had.",1

u8MeW2r_qq0	Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!	I just want to say I love you guys. You're the best. Having said that I do not like this new format. I don't like the game show feel at all. I prefer the more laid back format that was more like a group of friends arguing about movies. I'll watch either way. You guys are great and I'm sure you'll figure it out.		
u8MeW2r_qq0	Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!	If all records are being wiped clean, then I think the title should be vacated. Create a whole tournament around crowning a new champion for a new era of Movie Fights.		
u8MeW2r_qq0	Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!	Lego Batman was the best superhero move of the year

u8MeW2r_qq0	Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!	I miss the old format alot. Totally different from the OG movie fights		
u8MeW2r_qq0	Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!	Very happy with the new format! It's short, sweet, and to the point. It's fun and less negative, and feels rejuvenated and much more lively! Well done Screen Junkies!

u8MeW2r_qq0	Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!	Glad that Hal is the new host, but I personally think the old style was better.  I'll definitely still watch the new version, but I'll still be a little nostalgic for the old style.		
u8MeW2r_qq0	Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!	Glad movie fights is back, but the 3 fighter format is much better		
u8MeW2r_qq0	Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!	Sit down. Standing up is so hard to watch, I feel tired just watching you. (Hmmm, what does that say about me?)

u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I'm so happy Movie Fights is back. I'll watch regardless, but I have to give some constructive feedback. I agree that it's more interesting with three fighters. Spencer and Dan are among my favorites, but I'm sure you guys know that some of your guests and even regulars can be divisive, so it betters the odds to have a third. Someone mentioned the table being more ""chill""... I think it might help relax the fighters and keep it fun and friendly if they can sit down. I appreciate that you're shaking it up, but these are my thoughts. I'm glad I can look forward to Thursdays now. Thanks, guys.",1
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,SO MUCH BETTER,1
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,So happy this shit is back...on the low this is what hooked me to screen junkies,1
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I might like this 1v1 movie fights for more on a special occasion like the Mantz vs Rocha fight. The 3 man fight was cool because someone could sneak in with a really nice argument like what Mike Carlson would often do. I get that it's mess sometimes and it could drag out the show but it got 3 opinions out there that no one expected. Although I kinda like the fewer questions format it gave way for more in-depth arguments with each question. Plus, I like the 3 judges thing going on.

Also, I gotta be honest I'm not digging the new set. It looks like day time tv game shows. Not to say the old set was the best but it had fan and movie posters plus the toys on the booth added life to it. The atmosphere of everything felt like a wrestling event plus movie theater. I'm guessing everything in this sneak peak is just place holder.

And where's Ken Watanabe's ""Let them Fight"" phrase. I now tie that line to Movie Fights instead of Godzilla. But all-in-all I'm happy that Movie Fights is back and I'm glad everyone's jazzed for it to come back too.",1
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,The 2 person fight would be really fun every now and then but I think if you guys do want to do something other than the 3 man fight it will be hard to beat it. Great show though I'm glad you guys are back.,1

The idea of having multiple judges is excellent, as well as the fans being a component of that. However, I have to agree with what many others have said, please extend the fantastic informal feeling of your more recent videos by bringing back the classic 3-person melee and comfortable seated format of pre-revamp Movie Fights.

However, I feel that the new format is a bit too formal - it reminds me a little too much of that Jeremy Johns show SJ+ used to have. Maybe Movie Fights needs the 3rd person to keep the momentum up? 
Really enjoyed the depth in which the 2 fighters got to go into with their answers & having the host ask additional questions (not improv bits) really added some much-needed back-n-forth to the debate.
Can't wait to see what you come up with over the break!",1
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I liked this fight but I don't know if I would continue to enjoy this format going forward. This battle had your two best fighters but when you have other fighters that aren't as great, it would make the fight more one sided and boring. I loved the dynamic of the 3 man group because how they would undercut each other the first chance they got. I do like the new voting section because the fight feels more fair. I do understand the difficulty of making this voting process work with 3 people but I hope they could try.
As a side note I really miss the sound affects, cheers, and point animations throughout the show. This movie fight was too quiet and kinda bland",1
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I love all the new changes; although maybe make the set a little brighter. The new format is great, 2 fighters to 3 judges seems more fair.

It focuses the fight and allows for the judge to better control the chaos. But, I prefer 3 fighters. It allows for more points of view over the course of the fight and by limiting the fight to two people it reduces the number of competitors we'll get to see moving forward. Just my thoughts.

You don't need two people for the computer portion; fact checking and social media. Love Hal and adding sub questions during each argument. Two fighters is fine only if you pick two strong fighters every time. A point for the poll is stupid, people vote based on their favorite pick not the best argument. The new montage is terrible.

u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Welcome back fighters! I'm glad Movie Fights is back, the three-judge system seems fair and Hal is great as the host. I especially liked how he introduced questions mid-fight to bring out more from the fighters. This episode was ok to test the waters and as a comeback fight with just Dan and Spencer, however I think the show will feel a little dry if it's just going to be 2 fighters from now on. A very big part of the charm of MF is the slight chaos and hijinks that ensue from having 3 fighters competing against each other. I also agree with others that it feels a little too formal with having the fighters standing behind a podium, the table felt more intimate and relaxed. One other thing I noticed, and I figure you'll be able to fix in upcoming episodes, is that at some points there were awkward pauses/silences in the transitions from round to round and at the victory ending. Even if they are just sound effects I guess the absence of the 'ding-ding!' at the beginning of each round and the cheering crowd effect at the end was noticeable. Other than those things it's great seeing the show back, and I'm looking forward to the new and improved Movie Fights once you see all the feedback :)",1

 If I had one suggestion it would be to turn the fighter podiums so they are facing each other.  Talking to Hal they had to turn their head quite far.

u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"Great episode, enjoying (mostly) the new format, BUT a couple things. One, I think the fan voting is a bad idea. I feel like it should be a ""help"" but not an instant deciding factor. I think that having the fans vote is more for their opinions, or their favorite, not the better argument. 

Secondly, PLEASE use Roxy Striar as your ""main"" judge in the future (if she is willing to do it). She is GREAT at judging. Watching her do almost 100 TV Fights episodes (which I also hope you bring back) she was not biased (or knew how to keep her bias in check), she really listened to the fighters, she could regulat a match, and she never interjected anything that might change the arguments. She was the BEST judge of the various judges that were on the old format and ""Fights"" shows. (thumbs up if you agree)

As for the positives of the new format, I liked almost everything else. The best 4 out of 7, the number of ""normal"" rounds versus speed rounds, the ""Backwards"" fight and the ""Sabotage"" speed round. Those were done in different ways in previous episodes, but THIS is the perfection of these types of ""trick"" rounds and I loved how well they worked. It feels more professional, it could be great, and I am hoping that this format is also well loved by the fans! (it is by me)

one final suggestion, have a physical (and visible to fans/fighters) timer on set for the speed rounds. That way we can all see it and it adds the right kind of stress to the fighters SEEing their time disappear fast. 

Looking forward to more episodes!",1

u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"First off let me say THANK YOU  for bringing it back! 
I only discovered the show about 6 months ago and have already burned through every ep. It makes my long commutes, and traffic bearable, and even dare i say something I look forward too.
Now for the new changes I only have 1 real complaint. (the second issue i believe is a non issue because this was a grudge match and not a reg ep. 3 fighters is a must for the new season) The issue I have is with the voting going to the audience. The audience vote is an awful idea due to 1)trolls, 2) the fact that most people who post in the comments tend not to be the... how do I put it nicely... They are not the best of the community of sorts. *yes. the irony is not lost on me*  And 3) and the real reason is the audience vote is not based on the arguments. almost all votes are cast before the debater has a chance to plead their case making that vote in my opinion void , and against whole essence of what makes this show great. Please get rid of that OR only open up the poll after the arguments are done.  
Glad you're back at it! we missed ya!",1
u8MeW2r_qq0,Best Superhero Movie of 2017?? MOVIE FIGHTS SNEAK PEEK!,"I realize this is the first episode back and there is hope that it will find it's groove, but there is a lot to not like.

Like some have already said, the new set is not nearly as relaxed as the old one. In addition, going for a high-school debate tone is not what I would consider a Movie ""Fight"".

This new format simply has zero energy.",1

Buggy sound quality, too much background open air/room reverb on Hal. (Although thank you for putting lavaliere mics on Roth and Danielle, do that with everybody even if you leave the desk mics as props) Graphically it feels like Costco style branding now.  The one on one format basically makes it too similar to Shmoedown but with debate instead of trivia.  The energy is gone.  Hal is a good fighter but isn't the right host for this format, and you can't get Ken Napzok so I don't have a solution for you.

9VvCdAopEy8,Suicide Squad Extended Cut: Worth It?,"The extended scenes that were in the extended version were more about Harley and Deadshot than everyone else. It's obviously that the intention of the studio was to highlight Deadshot and Harley's scenes and downplayed all the other characters, especially the Joker since he would be an attention stealer.  The Studios wanted to invest on Harley and Deadshot because they are the ones who will continue in the future sequels.",1
9VvCdAopEy8,Suicide Squad Extended Cut: Worth It?,The Joker is a very well know character who had several portrayals on screen and the late one won an oscar.  Jared Leto had all the expectations on his shoulder and was the most anticipated character. What WB and Ayer did with his character? They cut his several minutes scenes into scenes with just seconds or one minute at most and spread those scenes along the movie without making a logic connections between those scenes.,1
9VvCdAopEy8,Suicide Squad Extended Cut: Worth It?,"Was  Will Smith performance good? Where is the stamina and coldness of Deadshot, who is a hired assassin and doesn¬´t care if he lives or dies? Will Smith is doing what he does in all the other movies. He is this sympathetic character that is trying to do the right thing. People liked his portrayal because Deadshot is a character little known and people don't know much about him and that is why will smith portrayal passed as good. Smith along with Robbie had the most stand out scenes and also more screen time than any other character and still Smith couldn't pass the coldness and toughness that is intrinsic to Deadshot's personality. I felt that all the characters were downplayed,  because of Will Smith lack of intensity, boldness, and toughness.",1
9VvCdAopEy8,Suicide Squad Extended Cut: Worth It?,"well guess who wrote the lines that leto said, that were on the nose? ayer. leto has a lot of energy and hes got some solid ideas. what he needs is better direction. he needs someone to guide him of when to tone it down and when to go all out because he seems so excited about the character, at the opportunity to explore it and try different things. he's got an intensity that i like, and he plays more and has fun. he's not so...serious. i get it, ledger is amazing bla bla bla. he's subtle. well this joker isn't. hes a madman who likes to play himself up. i enjoyed it. but what really gets me with leto is the way he moves. his gestures and hand motions. the way his eyes have this blank emotionless stare. its mesmerizing to watch. he's the joker at all times. like a switch.",1
9VvCdAopEy8,Suicide Squad Extended Cut: Worth It?,"I completely disagree with Dan's opinion on Leto's Joker. He just wants another Heath Ledger performance, he wants the same stuff we've already seen. I loved Ledger's Joker, it was truly an incredible piece of acting. But I feel like Dan and everyone else on here wants more and more of Ledger. I want a different Joker, not the same stuff we've already had come before. They sounded like they wanted a dark, brooding Joker, wtf?! That would be boring as hell, Ledger's Joker was brooding at times, and it worked on so many levels, but the way they were talking was as if they wanted Leto to just be a miserable emo the entire time. I've wanted a balls to the wall insane Joker for a while now, and Leto gave me that in the most perfect way. He was a showman, an entertainer. And there is a version of The Joker who incorporates those themes out there, we just hadn't seen it on the big screen yet, until Leto. I admire that he didn't try to copy Ledger, sure his voice may have sounded similar, but you could tell he wasn't trying to imitate him. I think Leto's Joker voice changed a little from time to time in his scenes in the movie anyway, which I enjoyed, just highlighted The Joker's madness and capacity for wicked and crazy humour.",1

He comes across as a whiney baby with no menace who is more concerned with ""talking about being the Joker"" then actually being The Joker.

There is no scene in this entire movie where he is shown to be as extremely violent and unsympathetic as the character is supposed to be. This is meant to be a guy who has and will kill men, women and children in the blink of an eye, someone so dangerous and unhinged that even his closest henchmen live in fear of what he might do to them.

How is this Joker going to play alongside Affleck's Batman, it is going to be laughable when these characters have their first onscreen interaction. 

This Joker poses no threat to Batman and Affleck's Batman is so extremely violent that he would just kill this Joker the second he was in striking distance.",1

9VvCdAopEy8	Suicide Squad Extended Cut: Worth It?	Shame, I enjoyed the movie enough to see it twice, but something really felt off with it, like something was missing. I was hoping the Extended Cut would add the missing pieces. Maybe worth picking up in a sale one day.		
9VvCdAopEy8	Suicide Squad Extended Cut: Worth It?	The extended version was originally produced by Peter Jackson with the release of the Lord of the Rings franchise over ten years ago. At the time it was necessary, seeing as how people were not accustomed to sitting in a theater for such a long period of time at that time. Peter Jackson's continuation with the extended version makes sense (and somewhat poetic in said continuity) seeing as how he started it with the Lord of the Rings pictures and moved on with the Hobbit pictures (no comment on the King Kong extended, though). Since then, however, producers have recognized the significant cash flow of the extended edition despite the fact that TODAY it's unnecessary. People are not afraid to sit three to four hours in a movie theater to watch a movie, and to release the same movie TWICE is just a means to grab more money. Simply release the whole movie in one shot. For this reason, I would say to boycott the whole extended version theme UNLESS it is the Lord of the Rings or the Hobbit. That's just me, though.

9VvCdAopEy8,Suicide Squad Extended Cut: Worth It?,"Pretty much nailed it on the standards bit. I'm that seemingly rare person that likes both. But I like DC more. I grew up on reruns of 60's Batman, Batman the animated series and the rest of the old DCAU, the 70's Superman, the Burton and Schumacher Batman's (which aren't nearly as bad when you realize it's meant to be like the 60's series), even the Green Hornet - I want the DCEU to succeed as well as their CW shows mostly have (as much potential as Gotham has in it's cast I still find that show an abomination). But they do need to get their act together. The thing with Squad is that while it is, dare I say lighter, than BvS, it has the same writing and editing issues and it's  pretty short film by comparison. DC needs to make movies long as they need to be within reason. They need 3 hours to tell the story? Use 3 hours long as it's good because all those LotR movies are in their base form, 4+ hours extended. And the thing is, DC is casting well. Yes, Eisenberg was a massive misstep, that they could potentially write out for the real Lex, little as we get I liked all the characters. And there is a ton of potential but they wasted it on rushed/bad writing. At least unlike BvS, which you guys point out in the Honest Trailer of it, they didn't blow about 5 awesome storylines for movies on one mess of a film. 

That said, it more than deserves a better written sequel. And actually, I think they can handle multiple characters just fine. It's literally just the story and editing... except for the terrible writing for Superman (Seriously, were at a point he's killed a Robin and possibly had a ""killing Joke"" style event and the Bat hasn't killed Joker, Supes with probably half a dozen non lethal ways to disarm a human with a gun should not go straight to death by high speed impact and blunt force trauma, and the wording and all at the hearing and stuff rings to question has he done this other times besides that and Zod) and Snyder seemingly killing characters off to spite the Fan Base for not taking MoS as well as he wanted. I'm thinking with the Harley movie they just need 5 characters, Harley and Ivy, Katana (you introduced her, use her some more, especially since she may have been sent to track Harley down),  Black Canary, and Barbra Gordon (as Oracle). I don't list Joker cause it's a Harley movie, he's going to have some kind of roll chasing her to get her back or maybe shes out for payback cause he's wronged her again. 

As far as Ayer goes, I'm willing to give him another shot. Keep Goyer away from the movies. Sure, he has names like Blade and work on the Nolan Batman's to his credit. He also has the Not as well received Blade stuff, both Ghost Rider movies, Mos, BvS, and that Nick Fury movie Marvel would like everyone to forget about with the Hoff. That last one in particular I think should send up some red flags. And I'm sorry, but anything beyond visuals because I can't deny he does that right, keep Snyder away from things. Only reason I'm not dreading Wonder Woman since he's listed as a writer is that two other people are working the screen play and one of those two is Geoff Johns. It's really do or die for DCEU right now. If Wonder Woman and Justice League don't meet fan expectations, theres a good chance no one shows up to Flash and Aquaman the next year.",1

There are quite psychopaths, there are loud and 'in your face' psychopaths! Moreover, there are THREE types of Joker in the comics - a criminal, an anarchist and a fucking crazy and violent one. Jared Leto is playing a crazy person who cannot control their face, emotions, mood swings - anything! 

P.S. Oh, you don't see a bike and randomly have weird thoughts? Maybe you are not crazy like Harley? Don't forget - she is as insane as the Joker. It means her mind works in a different way.",1

9VvCdAopEy8,Suicide Squad Extended Cut: Worth It?,I actually thought the extended cut was worse than the theatrical cut because in my opinion all they did was add a bunch of bad and pointless scenes to an already bad movie.,1

9VvCdAopEy8,Suicide Squad Extended Cut: Worth It?,"I haven't seen the extended cut yet but I plan on getting it because I'm into that kind of stuff. Personally, I think that Leto's Joker is a really good interpretation of the character and is a faithful portrayal because the Joker, to me, is a theatrical psycho. He has his own brand of murder, with his infamous laughing gas, for example. Leto's Joker may not be as developed as Ledger's Joker and is way more in-your-face but it is still a very interesting take. The Joker in Suicide Squad fit well with his environment, just like every other interpretation that has been before, and I think that if you changed him then it would ruin the movie and mess up the approach.",1

9VvCdAopEy8,Suicide Squad Extended Cut: Worth It?,"my biggest disappointment with the suicide squad movie was how nice the ""villains"" are. I wanted them to be out for themselves, because that's what made them so different and interesting to me, because they weren't the avengers. a good example is how Deadshot is told he can be with his daughter if he shoots Harley before she gets away, so he misses on purpose, and the other ""villains"" are like ""nice one mate"". really corny and kinda out of character. I think it would have been more interesting and surprising if they committed to him being a bad guy and he tried to actually kill her, so that he could see his daughter. they were just too nice, and corny sometimes.",1
9VvCdAopEy8,Suicide Squad Extended Cut: Worth It?,"A lot of the Joker lines were improvised by Jared Leto and it showed... it just came off kinda try hard.

And wtf?? You're saying that Jared Leto's Joker is bad because he's all out with the crazy? Have you ever heard Hamill's Joker? He's all out crazy too and he is the best Joker ever. So Leto have a good potentional and is really good playing Joker. Of course the way how he looks is something different. That's not Leto's fault but the creators fault I guess.",1
9VvCdAopEy8,Suicide Squad Extended Cut: Worth It?,its still a piece of shit just watch that one joker scene they added on youtube don't give money to this piece of shit marketing gimmick,1

Hal is great... sometimes in doses lol and the vote feature is great. id love to talk about moves with you guys but in the meantime, i will enjoy the materials you release. Keep it up",1

prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"I actually only just caught up on why changes happened. Sorry to hear and I'm glad it was taken so seriously and things have resumed. But it's quite obvious from the comments that the previous format worked better. Multiple judges could be a great thing, but the three fighters definitely seems to be the go. I also prefer mulitple quicker fights rather than 3 longer ones. I see arguments that people can go deeper, but when there's one fight I don't connect with (sometimes I just don't want to hear anything about a movie before I've seen it, and we outside the US often get films later) I'll often skip through it, but with the new format you lose a huge chunk of the show.

This seems to have the fun sucked out of it. Each fight is way too drawn out. I like Hal as the host but would like him to lead the fighters less. Having 3 judges is good though. 

In fact it is less of a fight and more of a discussion.

The audio it a bit weird. Also instead of the polls I would rather see the reintroduction of the 'fans on the couch' as your popular vote.

I will probably keep checking in to see if the format is changed and the fun is brought back, otherwise the show the way it is now is not for me. Which is cool, especially if lots of people are enjoying the new look and format.

prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"I gotta agree with most of the other comments about the new format. The reason the old movie fights was so good is how natural it felt with a bunch of good friends sitting down to talk movies. The rules were there to keep things moving but weren't too important and everyone just felt comfortable. The new format doesn't feel comfortable for anyone and the two fighters opposite eachother is much more confrontational than the friendly banter before. Just my opinions though, I still love the show and I wish y'all luck in the future!",1

I think that doing a 2v2 fight would be an alright idea. Two teams of two players on each and they have a debate.
Then the winning team gets split in two and they have a quick one-on-one to be crowned the ultimate winner. 
This means that there are over 3 fighters so there is more craziness BUT there are still only two teams so there is still a focus on the arguments.",1

Yes, with two, you can go ""deeper"" into the topics, but it's less dynamic. I think that's also because fighters are standing. Sitting around a desk makes the participants more relaxed, therefore my lively. Standing behind a podium feels staid and formal, like a political debate.

prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"The first debate for best movie of 2017 was focused only on the social commentary of both films and while they both have powerful messages it's kind of a huge disservice to filmmaking in general to not even discuss aspects how the film was shot, how the story was told, even how the film was overall directed. Both of those films had a lot to say, and it was great to have interesting social commentary told well more than once in the span of a year but there was little to no debate on the quality of filmmaking and it was  a little disappointing because I know both panelists see a lot of movies and know a lot about filmmaking.",1
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),standing? that's very aggressive,1
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"This is not a movie fight! Taking it to two fighters makes it two people taking turns to say a monologue. You have destroyed what made this interesting. I have watched every old style movie fight and enjoyed it no matter who was on it, but the last two shows have been boring to listen to and allows no banter.",1
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"Yeah, I will repeat what was already said. The two player format only gives us 2 ideas and with 3 you could cover more genres/tastes/arguments. Unfortunately with 3 players you lose the clear function of the 3 judges (good change). Right now their decision cant turn into stalemate. So maybe 4 judges(add Hals opinion)? Lastly the standing, podiums and an actual host really makes this look like a cable TV show. Before it had a chill atmosphere for casual movie talk.",1

prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"Really glad to see it back, but I think the third fighter allows for more interesting arguments and rebuttals. The three judges format is good and Hal is a great host. I know people are harping on you guys sitting down, I just think the problem is podiums make it seem a little bit debate club and it feels less intimate and spontaneous.",1
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),I think three people works better. Every game show in history has at least three people. Find me one that doesn't. Don't mind the new set or format that much but it needs three people.,1

I think it would be improved though if the two fighters were on the same side of the set, i.e. Switch Hal and Danielle's positions. I think that this would allow a bit more back and forth between the two competitors and also avoid the need for split sceen which I found a bit annoying.",1

prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"I do not particularly mind the two fighter format. However, with only two fighters, it is much easier for the fights to lose steam if the fighters are too friendly or lack aggression, as happened in the first round here. However, I think as long as the more formal nature of this format is embraced, and both fighters are eager to attack, this can be a just as successful and fun as the old movie fights.",1

prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"I'm really happy to have Movie Fights back. What I like about the new format is what a lot of people don't like: the two fighters. I agree with some that the third fighter kept things more intense and interesting because you could have an argument pulled in a lot of different directions, but I'm also a guy that liked the civil fights more than the chaotic fights. Three fighters would sometimes become too much of a circus.

That being said, two fighters does feel very formal. This isn't always a bad thing. We have the potential of getting into deeper arguments when people are nice, civil, and taking turns. What was really amazing in this fight was how much fun you could see Danielle and Joe having. Two fighters keep them focused just on the other player and that produces some great moments.

I love the show and even with a lot of people clamoring for three fighters, you've created a great format that works. Also, Hal is great and I love his little challenges like the rant and the song. Great work, Hal.",1

A group of people sitting around the table discussing things they're passionate about unabashedly. Right now this all seems so wooden and not natural. It's lost its heart, bring back the casual table, not formal podiums. Hal needs to loosen up too, i used to love him, but it just feels like nobody doing this right now is passionate about it.

This also has to do with the fighters. Joe and Danielle seemed a bit timid in the first round, but really hit their stride in the second and third rounds.

-I haven't seen I TONYA.
-I'd say all the villains in GET OUT are equally good. I wouldn't say that ROSE stands out.
-Denis Villeneuve's directing was good, but I wouldn't say it was among the best of the year.

Now, my personal picks:
-Best movies: DUNKIRK, THE LEGO BATMAN MOVIE and A SILENT VOICE.
-Worst movies: FALLEN, THE NUT JOB 2, RINGS and UNDERWORLD 5.
-Best villains: THE MAN IN BLACK from THE DARK TOWER, PHILIP KRAUSS from DETROIT and KEVIN WENDELL CRUMB from SPLIT.
-Oscar for Best Director: My nominees would be Rian Johnson, Christopher Nolan, Ruben Ostlund and Edgar Wright... and Nolan would be my winner.",1

prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"First of all, I love screen junkies for really long time so I'm not here to troll or hate. I understand everything Dan wrote and I'm with you on searching new formats for MF.

But this is also why I need to write this: current idea doesn't work for me, like at all. MF was always more like a passionate discussion club at one table. Almost like ""Who's line is it anyway"" - points did not matter for me. I loved to listen to Dan's, Spencer's, Joe's, Andreyko's arguments. I loved to listen to Alicia Malone, or Roth, or Danielle. There was discussion, there was argument, there was passion and fire (Rocca vs Mantz for life!).

Now it is more like Movie Figths dressed up to be variation of Movie Games. This is not discussion, this is just two people showing off, throwing statements at each other, with funny guy in the middle who's main goal is to be funny (and you are Hal, just it is not how it should be in MF). Movie Games are/were cool but as a 20 min entertainment. MF were always so, so, so much more than this. When you got into argument like the one over TFA or Jurrasic World - for me it could last one hour, just for this one point and it was hell of a show! All of you always complained ""omg, we're 1,5 in!"" or ""omg, we're almost 2h""! I watched (literally) every MF since it came out and I always thought: MF longer = MF better and more fun.

Even the interactions between contestants were better. When you show both players now on split screen it has less emotional impact, they can be even in different places/sets for all I know. And this strange TV-game-show vibe which is not (in my opinion) a good thing for MF.

Sorry to say all this, I really wanted to like new direction but I can't falsely praise it just for the praise. Please think of something different than original MF (I understand your need to do so) but maybe somehow closer to that format, not closer to corky, awkward TV game show.

Sincerely, your fan for ages

I think to make the stakes interesting, at least 3 need to be present so everyone has to be mindful of the person they spent less attention towards. Also, it is harder to get heated if it isn't a group discussion. Ascetically, the separating of the participants makes this look more like a less intimate and friendly competition.

We need 3 fighters; yes, someone will get a crappy answer more than likely but that‚Äôs the fun part of movie fights - when Nick Mundy argues for Jackass 2 and wins, that‚Äôs what makes this show special. 

Have them sit down - yes, I know they can stand for an hour or two, but it makes the show more formal and less like the hangout everyone enjoys. It‚Äôs less like the family we know and love. When your friend is standing in your house, it‚Äôs uneasy and offputting. When the contestants sit down, it feels like we‚Äôre all just having a chat (even the audience).

About the format easy mode now would be ""make a really good modern answer to pander to the audience vote""... Audience votes have always sucked 
If we are sticking to 2 contestants and 3 judges, let each judge score on a category... Especially as Hal throwing in random ""sing a song/give a rant"" really benefits certain fighters....
Also 3 questions doesn't allow funny random weird answers to come into play as much anymore, Dan being my favourite fighter then that's a plus, Mike being my second it's a con.

prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017?

This reminds us of movie fights we would have with our own friends, but sometimes we wouldn't have the company or the knowledge to do it.
This is not good... And its a pity, because you have all the right ingredients. It's not that I'm hating it just because it's different. But it's just so far away from what it could be. Do you really want Movie Fights to be this official and 1 on 1 all the way through? For me, the third opinion is what made it interesting. Instead of a simple, dry, two-way debate, you have a brawl.

Polls getting input in the outcome just seems to be pandering for more subs and likes and not beneficial to the process",1
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"This format is a downgrade.  In almost every respect.  It was better with 3 contestants because it allows for multiple counter-points, choices, and people to tag-team up on other's arguments.  In addition, I respect the move to use 3 judges, however there is absolutely no reason why the fan's vote should count as anything more than *maybe* a tiebreaker.  Ultimately, by using the raw fan vote, all you're really doing is picking whichever movie is more popular.  For example, how many people saw The Big Sick vs. Get Out?  The latter probably outnumbers it by more than 5 to 1, so of course the fan vote is going to sway in that direction.  It ultimately makes the fan's overall input actually *worse* than nothing because a contestant could easily just pick the most obvious popular answer to every question and automatically get the fan vote because the more obscure pick wasn't seen by as many people.",1

prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"Honestly I don't even want to watch this with only two fighters.  It reduces the excitement and tension, and because there's less actual argument and more point-counterpoint it requires the judging to be much tighter, much more like a proper debate -- which this isn't, and will almost certainly never be, no matter what Dan says.

prXCYZsmfrQ	Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR)	Not liking this format, too much like a game show. I want to watch three nerds fight about movies around a table, not two contestants politely debate. If you are going to go this route, then I suggest getting some buzzers and dress the set up more like Family Feud, @Midnight, Jeopardy, Wheel of Fortune, or whatever. Either go back to the old format or do this one right, this middle ground isn't doing anyone any favors. As it is, I'm closing this one and have no plan to watch any more Movie Fights if this is what it is going to be.		
prXCYZsmfrQ	Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR)	Significantly less interupting in this one.		
prXCYZsmfrQ	Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR)	I feel like this was OK, and I get you maybe want to change the format because Andy's presence might reek over that but, something feels really off whilst watching this. It was a lot nicer when the competitors were sat down and debating that way, it feels less like a presidency election, which is SO what this is, It feels way too much like you're watching Wheel of Fortune, which as good as Hal is, his host voice for this i'm not a fan of personally, i'll give it a chance but PLEASE get a third competitor, because it opens up so much more than when you just have two competitors, it gets even more competitive. Please, if you can, revert, like i've seen some people in the comments saying ""We hated the host not the old format"" to which I agree, because **** is gone, doesn't mean you can't carry on with what you had, but I don't blame any of you if this way entirely changed for comfortability sake.		
prXCYZsmfrQ	Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR)	Honestly I got so bored half way through the first debate that I started scrolling through the comments and ended up pausing the video cause the repetitive comments became more interesting. I really want the old format back it just had a lot more life to it then this bland over polished nonsense		
prXCYZsmfrQ	Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR)	ehhh yikes. I dont like this new set up. Go back to 3 people and have them sit down. No one likes standing like for an hour at a podium.		
prXCYZsmfrQ	Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR)	I like Hal but as a host makes me feel rushed. I think it's just his style. Talks fast, breathes heavily to account for that talking and has some nice riffing. As a movie fighter he's just a giant run on sentence sometimes which I hear in his hosting. I'd prefer Dan to host but I can understand if he wants to continue to fact check and not be bound to hosting.

HAL
The Fact that Dan is more involved
The Fact that there are 3 judges

Films not addressed from Three Billboards to Shape of Water to Dunkirk to Phantom Thread to XYZ didn't get a single word in despite extremely obvious merits, and I think a third fighter would touch further in broad categories. I feel like it also adds a great bit of spontaneity, like teaming up on one argument, or having someone shoot down two people back against the wall.

prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"Whilst i liked the old format with 3 fighters, i do kind of prefer just the 2. In the old format there was multiple times it just descended into a shouting match and the loudest/strongest voice was the one that got heard and some of the fights got into less about the debate and more about who could just control the room. It didn't happen all the time but there was certainly situations where there was just to many voices, this feels more structured and organised and easier to give both arguments equal time, and no one can just get 2v1 and shut out the conversation

I also think with hal's hosting style and posing them the questions rather than just leaving it to them to fight on the movie alone adds an extra element to the debate and probably wouldn't work as well with 3 ""fighters""

And finally i think with 2 fighters you have a better chance of not falling into what was my biggest problem with the old format (and why i stopped watching weekly), repetitiveness. I know its hard to get people to be willing to give up their time for this (especially if its live and has to be at set times very week) but the old movie fights ended up feeling like the same 10 fighters rotating, with only 2 each week i think even if you have a similar issue with the numbers of guests you can get it will be less noticeable as you wont be matching opponents as often",1
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),Overall I'm like the changes. Just needs a little more spice without losing the friendliness.,1
prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"I think the 3 fighter format is definitely better and as trivial as you probably think it sounds, having the contestants sit down around a desk is definitely better imo. It just feels more natural and fun.",1

prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR),"what/who is the best/worst...?"" questions actually are much better 3 contestants I feel. I really disliked the 2 choices for ""best"" and while the 2 choices for worst were both bad I think there were a few movies that were worse. I don't even recognize the 2 choices for ""best"" villains as valid. Having a third contestant gives a much better chance of getting it right in my mind even if they don't win at least I would get to hear someone I agreed with. Easy fix for best/worst is to give choices, maybe 5 picked by the fans or judges?		
prXCYZsmfrQ	Best/Worst Movies of 2017? MOVIE FIGHTS (RADFORD vs STARR)	Like others, I miss the older format, especially with 3 fighters.  This feels too ""attempting to look professional"" and I preferred the more casual atmosphere of the older ones, like 3 friends sitting on a couch debating dumb stuff like we all get into with our friends.  Keep the multiple judges, the set looks nice, but I wish it'd feel less like a cheap game and and more like a fun casual sort of thing.

prXCYZsmfrQ,Best/Worst Movies of 2017?

Like most comments, I agree that three fighters created a better fight environment rather than just two people having a debate. The feel of the new show seems artificial. The standing up may be the reason it feels odd, and if they were all sitting down maybe it would be different. Higher production value is loved but not at the cost of the fun, more natural fights. Having a new judge/host is great (thank you hal!) and the three judges i hope will get rid of the false accusations of favoritism‚Äôs from the judges.

My one critique, as many have said, is that I wish there were three fighters again. That one extra person just makes it all the more interesting statistically. Like, we know either Joe or Danielle is going to win..it's not that compelling, but adding that singular person makes it feel like anyone's game and then the final round is that much more interesting. Also, I like the additional judges but I feel like viewers shouldn't be one. They, largely, will pick what they most enjoy as we've seen in the past instead of basing it off the arguments.",1

wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,The Spiderman costume is AWFUL. It looks SO FAKE and CGI. Amazing Spiderman 2's costume NAILED IT.,1
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,"I went to see Batman v Superman today and the trailer in question trailer was shown before it. After it was over, while I snickered to the fact they  had just showed a Marvel trailer before a DC movie, I heard two school boys speak to each other in the row under me. I heard the first one say what translates to: ""so they got Spidey? Awesome."" . The other answered: ""Yeah, the cherry on the top of the whipped cream"". The first kid replied (I'll break down the translation, it was a pun). I burst laughing and literally had to stuff my scarf into my mouth, because it was a good and a bit dirty pun. The boy said: _""kirsikkana kermaperseen p√§√§ll√§""_. While _kirsikka_ is the cherry, and _p√§√§ll√§_ means above or on top of, the word for whipped cream is _kermavaahto_, literally ""cream foam"". _Kermaperse_ means a person who is snobbish and indifferent towards the poor, but the literal meaning is ""cream booty"".

I don't even know why I wrote this down... Forgive me (sorry not really sorry)...",1

wmCnXGaPAL8	Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!	Too much Spidey. Maybe a back shot or only a web shot. Not a full frontal. I think the success of Deadpool and the hype of BvS had Marvel nervous.		
wmCnXGaPAL8	Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!	If Spidey in the trailer is a CGI, it actually doesn't look too good. I agree with how they reveal Spidey too, just the right amount of time. About the new costume design, at first I was still judging it real hard, but after another look....meh, whatever. I can accept that. Also, FINALLY SPIDEY GOT REACTIVE EYES.

wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,"But I kinda don't like the idea of Stark making him a suit.

If he made an upgrade, sure.

But I'd still want the costume he wears to be the one he made himself. It shows his ability to excel despite lack of resources and experience, and independence in becoming a superhero all by himself at 15 without being a billionaire or a trained soldier/agent.

Also, I read somewhere that when writing the comics, Ditko specifically made Peter SEW his own costume, to pay tribute to his mother and hometown where he also learned to sew.

So (haha, unintentional rhyme) changing the suit's creation into being made by Stark with tech instead of Pete himself, at home, with his own hands; to me, feels like a betrayal to his wonderfully, carefully constructed backstory & origins, and by extension his writer/artist/creators :'(",1

Still i would watch it if reviews are good because BATMAN.
spiderman is not CG except his eyes and i am relieved that they showed him in trailer because:

1. i was really worried about him being included in civil war and spiderman being a 16 year old as i wanted it to be good.mow i think he MIGHT be great.

Personally I think the trailer was awesome enough without the reveal, though I totally  understand it.

wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,"Best Spider Man costume to date. Very much classic Spidey, and we finally get the expression eyes that was sorely lacking in the last five movies. Sorry fake fans, Deadpool stole them from Spider Man, who has been doing it since Amazing Fantasy. But if you picked up an actual Spider Man book prior to 2007 you'd know that.",1
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,It's weird that 4 grown ass men are getting hard on's for a 16 yo boy.

wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,"This trailer had everything I wanted. Tonally and thematically. I'm that much more excited for this movie! If this turns out as great as The Winter Soldier did (as it's certainly looking that way thus far), I can say with certainy that the Russo Bros. are the best thing to happen to the MCU.

Also, on the topic of Spider-Man, I'll admit I wasn't as taken by his costume until watching this. Seeing Coy talk about the Romita, Snr./Ditko eyes has certainly swayed me more to the look.",1

wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,"Love Spidey's new eyes but I'm a little on the fence about the rest of the costume, especially the new insignia. Then again, I didn't like Batman's new costume when it was first revealed and now it's grown on me so maybe this will be alright. As for Rhodes' potential fate? If he dies, who cares. The MCU is extremely cheap when it comes to hero deaths so if he bites it in this movie he'll just be back again in the next one",1

wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,"Also, I think the Spider-Man reveal was smart because 1.) It reassures the people who weren't entirely convinced Spider-Man was even going to be in the movie and 2.) It'll make a lot more people want to see the movie who probably weren't as excited to see it as others to begin with. Mostly because Spider-Man is one of the most iconic Marvel characters and people who aren't necessarily as invested in Iron Man or Captain America or the Avengers will want a sneak peak at how Marvel is going to handle Spider-Man's character.",1
wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,"I'm not going to lie....I dislike the new Spider-Man costume. It looks horribly fake, and it lakes texture.

wmCnXGaPAL8,Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!,"Hey, I have a small theory. It's a bit weird that they would show a death in a trailer, so a lot of people think it's a fake. But what if War Machine DOES die but, he might not be the ONLY death. This would have people think that one death would make all the other characters safe, but then BAM!! another one dead. I think this would enrage A LOT of people but it could happen. Though an argument against my own theory would be that it diminishes the importance of the first death so I'm not so sure.",1

The tone for the spidey looks wrong with the contrast. just awful. give it back to sony. Andrew Garfield can make more facial expressions and emotion  through his mask just by body language.

Actually, why did they bring up this science in the first place? They only showed it work like once.

Iron Man 1-3 mostly Tony's fault
Thor 1 and 2 somewhat Thor's fault
Hulk Bruce's fault to a degree
Captain America 1 and 2 are both Hydra's fault, Cap not having much involvement besides letting Bucky get turned into the Winter Solider (though in all honesty if you saw your friend fall off a train down a mountain in the middle of winter you would probably think he was dead too.) 
Avengers 1 sort of Thor's fault maybe a hint of Cap for letting the Tesseract get away in Cap 1
and Avengers 2 being mostly Tony and a little bit of Bruce as well as Thor. 

Though all in all I guess this would explain Tony's motivation and Steve's disagreement.

Anyway sorry for the long rant I just had to get that off my chest!",1

Granted I'll see BvS and I will be excited as a DC Fan to see it, but the MCU has built a world, it's characters for years now. I am emotionally invested in in the MCU right now and to see that family in disarray, for me, is more more climactic than being introduced to a new comic universe. Knowing that DC is starting a new universe makes the stakes for that movie feel lower because obviously those heroes will make it. Civil War feels like the culmination of an episodic series near its final act. The stakes are higher, new characters are being introduced, and the old characters may finally end their arcs.",1

This is NOT the best live-action Spider-Man costume we have seen, it is the SECOND best. The best looking costume is still the one from The Amazing Spider-Man 2.

This is coming from someone who has been a Spider-Man lover since he was 4 years old. The design is really good, and I'm really glad they went with the cartoony spider logo instead of a realistic looking one, but this is NOT the best Spider-Man suit we could have gotten (which is fine). I'm extremely confident that the portrayal of the character will be the best one we've seen yet, and that is enough for me.

Also, with only a handful of heroes going at each other can we really call this a 'war'?? Does marvel even have enough aptitude to make a serious story rather then continual light-hearted banter with no real conflict.

This just makes me all the more worried about Infinity Gauntlet if they are only gonna have a handful of characters and continue making conflicts/villains comedy relief. I'm kinda getting burned out with these repetitive PG Marvel movies. Civil War just seems very bland without the shock and craziness that the comic had (suburb getting blown up by B-class hero team, villains working for the pro-Ironman coalition,  deaths on both sides, the conflict of heroes revealing their identities and the conflicts with it, etc.) or the amount of characters that made it so war like.",1

wmCnXGaPAL8	Captain America: Civil War Final Trailer Breakdown - Spider-Man Revealed!	I know that the CGI of this movie is still a work in progress and it'll look much better in the finished product, but they really could've put more effort into the first official reveal of Spidey in the MCU...

Your abject hatred of all star wars movies to the point that you try to get them to stop making them has single-handedly reduced that number to 7.

6FGCpGNld0s,Worst Movie of Summer 2018?! MOVIE FIGHTS!,The Meg was bad. The characters were dull and I only enjoyed 2 characters. Why did Ruby Rose look like visual effects during the movie. I hated Jason Staham character i thought he was dull and cliche. I only enjoyed the little kid and that was it and the action scenes. I didnt care for the plot but at least the movie was somewhat self aware. Good action scenes are made from good lovable characters which you feel rewarded once you see everything built to the action which is always shown in MCU films. This movie relies on flashy but fun action scenes and cheap jokes. 6.9/10,1

It only bombed because the fans were boycotting Kathleen Kennedy for her overuse of the girl power message. 

As for the saga films, I don't think the hate will last. Fans used to hate on Revenge of the Sith and now they accept people who say it's the best one. TLJ may always leave a little bad taste in the mouths of some fans but there's no way they're going to hate Episode 9 as much. Remember.

VlaQXJCjcpI,Honest Trailers Commentary - The Conjuring,"I like the Conjuring movies. I feel they are a throwback to suspenseful horror (which is the best kind imo). 

James Wan understands true horror as it's not about how many teens a psycho serial killer can kill, but more about what lies around the corner, or what's behind the stairwell. Not all the scares work, but it's hard to scare people now-a-days as we're used to seeing so much fucked up things online anyway. He understands the build-up of tension in scenes and that's something Hollywood was never that good at (at least not in Horror).

To begin with,Pennywise is a being that was created by the maker of the macroverse in the amazing world Stephen King has created. He has been around since the beginning of time as well as his counter part, Maturin the turtle who one day had a stomach ache and threw up, and created the universe of Stephen King by doing so. 
So, having said that, Pennywise is not a clown, he is a celestial being which feeds on humans, who has no physical form and can take any shape he desires to intimidate, frighten and manipulate his victims.
I think the person who got the closest to getting right was the girl that tried throwing Pennywise into Harry Potter, that kinda would make sense,  since in Harry Potter they are many malignant being such as this on, dementors being a good example as dark, soul sucking creature. The reason why I can see pennywise being in Harry Potter is because not only could it be one of King's many worlds within worlds, but because magic and wizards appear often in his stories, a good example being the Dark Tower series. Also, a concept similar to Pennywise already exist in the Potter universe, this concept being the Boggart which is first found in professor Remus Lupin's class in Harry's third year in Hogwarts. A Boggart is an amortal  non-being which takes the form of his viewers worst fear, because of this no one knows it's true form. In my opinion, this creature is much like IT, and I can definitely see Pennywise being in the Harry Potter world, but definitely not in Pokemon or Suicide Squad.",1

Dark of the Moon has an impressive wing suit sequence, Age of Extinction has the Dinobots (even if they came in way too late) and The Last Knight has Anthony Hopkins. The first film has boring and unfunny Sam Witwicky scenes that are borderline unwatchable mixed with stupid and boring scenes with Rachel Taylor's character and boring army scenes and it just sucks.

yxohMmHFRUU,Which Franchise Would Be Most Improved By Adding Pennywise? - MOVIE FIGHTS DEBUT DEATH MATCH!!,"Round 4: mostly ignoring the arguments because I don't think anybody properly fought their point. Age of Extinction is by far the worst Transformers (haven't seen the new one, maybe its worse IDK). That said Phantom Menace is the clear winner and the reason is actually an argument that was made. In a Transformers movie you know exactly what you are going to get and you get it, if you don't like it it's your own fault for buying a ticket. Phantom Menace shits all over everything great about Star Wars. The light saber fight is not the best light saber fight, in fact I might call it the worst. It was nonsensical garbage and Darth Maul was not a bad ass. Maul was trying so hard to be badass and failed so spectacularly. No amount of fight choreography can cover the fact that the fight has no meaning, no weight, it's so pointless that they kill off 2 of the main characters in the film to attempt to force some meaning into it and they still failed. It doesn't hold a candle to literally any other fight in the series. It doesn't have remotely the emotional impact of Vader vs Luke in Jedi. Vader smacking down rebels at the end of Rogue One is a better light saber fight. Even Vader and Obi Wan's half ass fight in A New Hope is better.",1

Just as he is about to reach it a white gloved hand reaches out of the water and pulls him in. Pennywise takes him to his lair and bites his hand off. The boy screams. Just as he is about to bite the rest of the poor boys arm off he sees that the boys hand grows back. Pennywise looks at the boy in the face and says ""Why James what kind of special boy are you?"" Thats right the young boy is a young Wolvrine. Pennywise feasts on the ever healing James for days until his brother Sabertooth is able to track him down and save him. The movie then moves forward in time to the present day. The x-men get a report that young mutant children have been disappearing in maine.

Not that this necessarily would have had an impact on the result given how the final round was going, but I kind of feel that Ace should have had a 1-0 advantage going into the final round given that he had won two judging rounds and she came in through the ""loser's bracket.""

What happened Movie Fights? There was a time when every round and every fighter was interesting. 
Where are the interesting Panelists? Only Ace and Matt brought something to the table today.
Dan
Spencer
Nick 
Hal
Ellis
Mike
Roger
Trisha
Alicia
Napzok 

Those are the people we want to see guys, this time they were all nowhere to be seen. Love your show format, sadly todays fighters brought almost nothing to the table (except matt and ace as mentioned, they seem to fit the mindset this show requires, the transformer fight was pretty good).

I know that everyone of you do other things and dont always have time to do the show, and the different ideas applied to make the show more interesting by changing the format slightly like today are great, but at least one or two of the contenders we loved in the first year of the show should appear to make the show as great as it could be.
I dont mind new people, but when nine people completely new come around......there is a risk that several rounds fall completely flat.

Your fighter roster makes your show screen junkies, and i feel it is deep and rich (jeremy jahns and chris stuckmann and such are always welcomed guests).

Hope for a glory return to the golden days.

BRING IT ON DAN, TAKE ON SPENCER IN THE HEAVY WEIGHT FIGHT WE KNOW IT IS GONNA BE, CANT WAIT!!!!

Round 3: Not the best of all time, but Daniel Craig in Star Wars the force awakens was easily the best recent one.

Imagine ( Donnie Drako and It Spoilers Ahead) Donnie contently laughing before he lets the plane crash into him in the primary universe, then as soon as the plane hits, he gets transported to a room of all white where he is met by Frank from the tangent Universe. He explains that all Living Receivers, after their deaths in the primary universe , are chosen to become inter-dimensional travelers (lets just call them travelers) mending and preventing rips and disruptions in time as to prevent as many occurrences of tangent universes as possible. But, if travelers were to stop preventing tangent universe creations or do something wrong their abilities would be stripped away from them and be banished to any given dimension. Pennywise was one of these travelers who did something terrible and was banished to the universe It takes place in. But, recently it had been discovered that he had been eating children for decades of his dimensions time, so Donnie gets sent to handle it. This movie would have a shit ton of lore and black story to work with, would actually make sense in their respective stories and Donnie Darko vs Pennywise The Clown in a one on one telekinetic match to the death.

I just the other day finally saw Resident Evil The Final Chapter and I am so glad that I didn't see it in theaters because I would have walked out in the first 15 minutes when they DON'T EVEN GET PARTS OF THEIR OWN FRANCHISE RIGHT! They destroy canon events that happened in the films, change parts of characters' history, contradict their own movies, and add in useless garbage to shoehorn in some thing that resembles an ""ending"". Where Alice and friends are all in a city that should be completely destroyed and Radioactive from the 5 Kiloton nuke that blew up 10 years before this ""movie"" takes place.
While we all know that all movies based off of video games suck. Paul W. S. Anderson made deliberate choices to contradict his own films and execute poor choices unbecoming of a director in Hollywood. Thus Resident evil sucks more than Twilight and Transformers.

The Mask movie actually was a terrible adaptation of the source material & they did two sequels with a different actors in the role of the mask.

yxohMmHFRUU,Which Franchise Would Be Most Improved By Adding Pennywise? - MOVIE FIGHTS DEBUT DEATH MATCH!!,"1)  Man of Steel-  I have only left the theatre angry after watching 3 movies in my life and two of them were in the DCEU franchise and Man of Steel was the first.  Zach Snyder has no concept of what Superman is or should be.  He took a the epitome of optimistic superhero characters and put him in muted, dark, and depressing story that set the tone for how DC Comics would be represented as for at least until Wonder Woman came out (there's even an argument to be made that that movie was too dark.)  It takes Jonathan Kent who is supposed to be the guiding light of morality for Superman, and Snyder makes him give the argument that heroes should let children drown if the outcome may be inconvenient.  Also, Superman who is supposed to stand for hope, not to mention truth and justice, is a murderer who causes the destruction of several 9/11s due to ineptitude.  This is a terrible movie, a terrible depiction of Superman, and it poisoned the well for the DCEU.

2)  Home Alone-  The first two movies are some of the best kids films ever made and then the franchise got progressively worse with each made for tv/direct to dvd addition.  So, let's have Pennywise, an entity that feeds off the fear of children, and have him face off against a kid that overcomes his fears and fights it off with deathtrap after deathtrap.  

3)  Neil Patrick Harris, Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle-  NPH shows up out of nowhere in this film without a hint of foreshadowing and it's the most memorable part of the film.  NPH plays a hilarious version of ""himself"" that shows off his acting range because this version couldn't be further from the real man.  It's the most memorable part of the film, and it was not only the beginning of a franchise for him, but the comeback that his career needed.  Without this cameo, there would be know Barney Stinson.

4)  Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides-  Full disclosure, I love the first 3 Pirates movies.  But, ""On Stranger Tides"" is terrible.  All of the new characters fell flat, there is far too much Jack Sparrow, and the plot is nonsensical and easily forgotten.  The movie is so bad that none of the new characters or any of the plot of this film is mentioned again in the next film of the franchise.  (My answer would totally have been Transformers: Dark of the Moon if it wasn't already taken.)

5)  Bonnie Wright and Daniel Radcliffe, The Harry Potter films-   The romance between Harry Potter and Ginny Weasley may have been different in the books, but these two had no reason to be together in the films, but more so, the actors looked bored together.

6)  Jack Black-  There's nothing about Jack Black's personality or career that says dark.  You wouldn't be able to take him seriously as the suave Bruce Wayne and certainly couldn't take him seriously as the Batman.  Can you imagine Jack Black in an anatomically correct rubber suit?

7)  Julie Walters as Mrs. Molly Weasley, The Harry Potter series-  She cares deeply for and protects not only her own 7 children but is like a second mother to Harry Potter.  Her children love her and she lives to take care of her family.  And when Bellatrix and the Death Eaters threaten her children, she kills Bellatrix to protect them.  You don't get much better than that.

8)  Ace Ventura-  After Son of the Mask, I don't think you can save that franchise even if Jim Carrey was to return to the role of Stanley Ipkiss.

9)  South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut-  It gave you everything that you could love from South Park and made brought it to the cinematic level.  It works just as much as a satirical comedy about censorship and bigotry as it does as a send up of movie musicals.  It was even nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Song.  Without South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut there would not be a Book of Mormon.",1

She only picked Pennywise in suicide squad because she didn't liked the clown (joker) in that movie

In Pokemon, Pennywise can be added as a legendary pokemon in a new season. There are some pokemon Gods in the franchise like Archeus, Giratina, etc. So an alien creature that can shapeshift imo isn't a bad idea at all as a pokemon. And Pokemon isn't always bright and cute, it has some dark moments too. You probably only watched some episodes of the series if you think that way.
In Suicide Squad, the problem is, she add Pennywise as Joker's brother. Are you serious? Joker is a human, and Pennywise isn't. I haven't watched IT and I know that. What could be a good idea is adding Pennywise into Suicide Squad without changing it's background story. I mean, it's background is already look like a super-villain.

O ponto de partida de ""Ultimato"" √© Tony Stark e Nebulosa no espa√ßo, 22 dias depois dos eventos de Guerra Infinita. √â uma expans√£o do que foi mostrado no primeiro trailer: √°gua, comida e oxig√™nio est√£o no fim, √© dif√≠cil sair dessa vivos. Ah n√£o ser, claro, que a Capit√£ Marvel surja para salvar o dia!
A trama gira em torno de viagens no tempo: para reverter as a√ß√µes de Thanos em ""Guerra Infinita"", os Vingadores precisam recuperar as Joias do Infinito antes que elas tenham sido coletadas pelo tit√£.
Personagens de outros filmes da Marvel ressurgem em ""Ultimato"", como Frigga (Ren√© Russo), morta em ""Thor: O Mundo Sombrio""; Alexander Pierce (Robert Redford), visto em ""Capit√£o Am√©rica: o Soldado Invernal""; Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell), grande amor da vida do Capit√£o Am√©rica; e a Anci√£ (Tilda Swinton), mentora do Doutor Estranho.
Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) ganha uma armadura..   ""Um verdadeiro espet√°culo cinematogr√°fico!!""",1

Remember, Thanos still demands your silence. As always, good luck and happy viewing..."" The Russo Brothers


Didn't even feel like a 3 h movie, it was gratifying how the story ended. Even if this story really ends in the upcoming Spidey-film. Is there sadness in the air. Of course there is. Sadness, tears of sorrow, also tears of joy and almost happiness and satisfaction in the end. Sad to see the heroes, that you know and love go, but at the same time satisfied for some of the heroes journey ended. Loki got his last hurrah and Steve's especially got a worthy ending. He did use a lot of language throughout. 


Who knows, what will happen during the next decade inside the franchise, when Disney+ releases the series, which hopefully are properly linked to these movies. No-one, who's worked to make these movies possible probably imagine, just how big the MCU would really get. It's gigantic and cannot be replicated.

5xyNqemLNxk,Marvel Studios&#39,"The one scene in my memory that sticks out the most in Infinity War is when the Avengers are on Titan and Thanos is being held down, he's being kept under via Mantis and they're struggling to remove his guantlet. There's a part where the camera moves just right to catch the characters as they're talking, and Stark talks to Quill, and the camera finishes with only Quill and Thanos in profile. Orchestrating that order is masterful. That's really tricky stuff to do in film making. There are a lot of scenes like this, this kind of quality, in there. These two directors know how to make perfect scenes. They've come a long way in their careers. *Spoiler for Endgame follows:*

We in the Philippines saw the movie 6hours ago and the whole theater I was on was cheering and crying whilst (again) personalities dear to the fans gave their swan song. And lemme tell you, the Net rumors about Steve Rogers saying farewell, well, It's a farewell but on a methaphorical, time- tampered goodbye kind of way, lemme just tell all the fans, Nothing that the Net rumors / plot theories describe what's gonna happen within the last Hour. Absolute Geekfest! The whole theater, young and old, able and disabled, war-torn geek and MCU newbie, everyone jumped, cheered and cried(I mean, massive wailing!) at A certain Hero's funeral service. He was there at the beginning, He was there at the end. and if you think the Captain Marvel movie was women empowerment, fellow geeks, you have no idea what Avengers Endgame is gonna show. The women! The Women! The whole marvel universe women!!! are gonna steal some glory for only a few moments BUT the moment was GLORIOUS!!! Even thor's coming in wakanda in Infinity War never comes close to it! and YES!!!! Captain America Wields a weapon he previously thought himself unworthy to bear(wink, wink!). And the immortal lines ""Avengers! Assemble!!"" When the good Captain utters it, not a few were having tears of joy. Well, I've spoiled enough folks, I'm gonna watch it again a few hours from now. Lastly, Thanos shows why he is the meanest, most egotistical, and unbelievably convincing Badass in the universe. I ca'nt type here what Cap Marvel does to him, though....

They helped me deal with problems without even being there physically, but they were there. These movies and these people showed me and reminded me what it's like to be a family, to be someone. Whenever I was down I went to them, and for that they will always remain in my heart. These people not only changed the film industry but changed people's lives.This is going to be astonishing.

Also, it was said, that if you think that this is a sequel to infinity war, you are greatly mistaken oh, but it is an entirely different movie. It was also set in the reviews that in the game will satellite and give us more insight indifferent perceptions of mini previous movies leaving up to end game, which tells me that it is, in fact, referencing time travel going back to other movies and giving us more and different information about important and key scenes from those movies. Everybody that reviewed it was basically blown away oh, some saying that they are an absolute mess after watching the movie and just simply full of a complete mix of emotions!

5xyNqemLNxk,Marvel Studios&#39,"Endgame Prediction: 

The Quantum Realm will play a huge role in Endgame. The White suits shown in the trailer must be the suits for the Quantum Realm. After Dr Strange looked at all the 14+ million outcomes. In the one that they win Tony Stark, otherwise known as Iron Man, saves the universe by using the Infinity Gauntlet. That‚Äôs why Dr Strange traded the stone for his life. Tony Stark might die or lose his left arm because Marvel has been hinting at it ever since the original Iron Man, the first  Marvel movie. Tony has always suffered injured to his left arm foreshadowing the event where he saves the universe. Captain Marvel will obviously play a huge role, but Iron Man will be the one that saves everyone.",1

That's like dropping an AR-15 into the hands of a random person and saying you're a Navy Seal now. Every powerful force user had to train YEARS to do the simplest thing and here she comes doing all the things right away. I hope she's a Palpatine clone that would be a twist.,1

SXZ60hNQYNw,"Avengers: Endgame Oscar Campaign Begins, But No Robert Downey Jr. - Movie Talk","Rey having parents or not having parents is irrelevant. She could be a nobody, or she could be from a family that has a history of force users. It doesn't matter, but it would give us, the audience, something interesting, you know like character development, which she really hasn't had yet. The argument that it diminishes what makes her 'special' is stupid. The only reason she is special is because she has the force, not because she's an orphan. Everyone can have the force argument is also way beyond stupid. Since when has George Lucas ever said or written that only specific people can have the force? The only thing he said was that you need midichlorians, and it's these microscopic beings that connect you to the force and allow you to use it. So yeah, anybody could be born with those things inside them. This is not a new concept, despite what some people would have us believe. But even if you have those, you still need serious training so that you can utilize them. How much training has Rey had? About 5 minutes worth and some books, and we're supposed to be rooting for her? This is the same problem I see everywhere. Some people don't want to work for anything, they want it all handed to them on a silver platter. Rey is a prime example, except that it is the writers who are handing her everything on a silver platter. Being strong with the force does not automatically make you a hero, a good person or an interesting character. It's the struggles they go through and the way they learn from their mistakes and grow as a person that makes us root for them. But Rey has had no struggle to get what she wants (other than scavenging on Jakku), not to mention that we still don't really know what she actually wants, other than her family. We know so little about her, so yeah, why not delve into who her parents were.",1

Another clear recommendation that you would expect if any of the actors/actresses were to be included was Scarlett Johanssen for Best Supporting Actress.  I would expect that RDJ and Scarlett still have good chances of nominations.  Once nominated(if they happen) then you should expect Disney to have a pretty strong campaign.,1
SXZ60hNQYNw,"Avengers: Endgame Oscar Campaign Begins, But No Robert Downey Jr. - Movie Talk","There's no reason for Rey to have a significant bloodline. I hope they don't go down that route. It's far more interesting to me for the most powerful Jedi to be an ordinary anomaly. But if all Jedi who can become part of the Force after death (thus far only five that we know of - Qui Gon, Obi Wan, Yoda, Anakin, and Luke) then can influence the Force to favour Rey, that also goes towards her seemingly uniquely powerful abilities. It's Kylo who is the Skywalker in this part of the story, Rey is not connected by blood.",1

SXZ60hNQYNw	Avengers: Endgame Oscar Campaign Begins, But No Robert Downey Jr. - Movie Talk	Thank you so much, Vinnie and Perri for acknowledging Rian Johnson's message about the force via Rey's parents.	
SXZ60hNQYNw	Avengers: Endgame Oscar Campaign Begins, But No Robert Downey Jr. - Movie Talk	We didn't need The Last Jedi to tell us that ""the force is for everyone"". There were literally thousands of Jedi who came from random families that used the force. She doesn't have to be related to a Skywalker or Solo, but there is definitely more to her than just ""they were nobody"". And this whole mixing the dark and light side being the balance in the force is just wrong. Balance of the force is not mixing light and dark. Balance of the force is what the Jedi's goal is: to make sure the sith don't corrupt the natural balance of the force. Skywalker is not going to be a title either. Almost everything that you guys said I disagree with.

But people are critical of an emotional performance in a well paced, well written comic book movie... but Joker deserves all the Oscars because... oh wait, it‚Äôs not the MCU so it‚Äôs ‚Äúart‚Äù, didn‚Äôt the director of joker just say he only made that movie just to prove a point to ‚Äúwoke culture‚Äù so why should a film where the director had admitted he doesn‚Äôt care about the character/source material so much because he just wanted to make a point but I thought comic book movies were supposed to accurate, and didn‚Äôt WB and Todd Philips also say Joker isn‚Äôt a comic book movie yet they want it to push the genre forward... make it make sense",1

lqQe7WsFVQg,Watch LIVE : Landing of Chandrayaan-2 on Moon&#39,"Actually, it deviated at an altitude of 4km. From that (38:28) onwards the progress was not as intended.

At 39:18 central engine should have been started, but I think it didn't (or exploded?). So a sharp decrease in altitude.

Remember it still had a high vertical velocity, so the impact speed is more than what it would have been for free fall before touching the surface. It would be a catastrophic damage to the instruments inside.

At 1:11:30, one can hear in the background a women scientist saying there is a lot of change in the doppler data.

Lander technology is new to ISRO, seperating with orbiter in the space, doing those complex maneuvers, following the intended path until 2.1 km is exceptionally good. That too all these things were done by the lander itself, no commands from the control i.e, automated.

If it lands in one piece on it's four legs, in right orientation to get max sunlight, then it's miracle. In that scenario one can hope for less damage to the instruments and to the rover. Hope for the best üáÆüá≥.",1

The mission was not a total failure. Taking off is one stage. The trajectory it followed was another, the circling of the earth's orbit before being flung into the moon's orbit was another. At least it did not lose 7 astronauts like the Americans did in total losing over 15 of them. Even then it was not called a failure. Because from these failures the scientific and human community learns.",1

2srV-bEi_DU,"Chandrayaan 2 - Landing on Moon - LIVE from MOX-ISTRAC, Peenya, Bengaluru","From the trajectory graph, it seems there should be some problem with some trajectory autocorrection module in the lander. Why do I think so? If you look closely at the red curve and at the blue curve, you will see a small spike the green curve makes towards north and is almost immediately brought back to the intended curve (red) by ""something"" (I think this ""something"" is some autocorrection module). Now the spike upwards or away from the red curve is caused by ""something"" on the moon's surface which we dont know (moon has very little atmosphere, so can't be wind, I guess.) . But the lander immediately autocorrects its path and is back on the red line. Next time that same factor hits the lander again. And this time for elongated duration of time. Why the elongated duration of time? I dont think it is because of the factor deviating the lander. I think it is a burst shot and not some continuous force. I think the trajectory autocorrection module did not start immediately this time. So the duration of time the lander was out of the red line was significantly more than the first time. Now it is commonsense to assume that once the autocorrection module starts, the lander is trying to regain its intended trajectory(the red curve) ""more aggressively"" than the first time. And so now you can see the lander going in the southern direction (in respect to the red curve). Maybe that module was not written correctly. So it did not stop at the right time (neither did it start at the right time). The influence of that module continued even though the effect was not present anymore. As a result it drifted more and more away from the red curve, finally crashing into the surface",1
